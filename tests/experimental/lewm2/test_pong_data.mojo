"""PongWindowSource bridge test (CPU, no neural net).

Builds a tiny in-memory `PongOfflineBuffer` with known frame bytes + a
mid-buffer episode boundary, samples (B, T) windows through
`PongWindowSource`, and checks the bridge contract WITHOUT running the
(expensive 84×84) model:
  1. sampled fp32 pixels == stored uint8 / 255 exactly,
  2. actions are valid one-hot rows (exactly one 1.0, rest 0.0),
  3. no sampled window straddles the episode boundary (the buffer's
     `_window_is_valid` rejection is honoured end-to-end).

Run:  pixi run mojo run -I . tests/experimental/lewm2/test_pong_data.mojo
