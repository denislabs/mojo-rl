"""Gates `mojo_rl/nn/core/safetensors_io.mojo` on CPU and GPU.

    pixi run mojo run -I . tests/nn/test_safetensors_roundtrip.mojo

`tests/io/test_safetensors.mojo` gates the FORMAT. This file gates the WALK:
that the names a model writes are the names it reads, that states travel with
parameters, and that a device model's weights actually reach the file.

## The three ways a loader passes without working

* **It loads nothing.** Every check below is preceded by proving the
  destination model DIFFERS from the source first — a load that matched no
  names would otherwise satisfy "the values agree" only when both models were
  identically initialised, which is exactly how these gates are usually built.
* **It loads parameters and skips state.** BatchNorm running statistics are a
  separate walk. A model whose convolutions are restored and whose statistics
  are not is a different function, and nothing about the parameter count says
  so. The BatchNorm leg perturbs the statistics away from their init (mean 0,
  var 1) first, because at init they are exactly the values a dropped state
  walk would leave behind.
* **It saves the host mirror of a device model.** On GPU the weights live on
  the device and `param.data` holds whatever was last downloaded — for a model
  built with `make["gpu"]` and trained, the initialisation. A file full of
  random weights saves without error.
