"""Unit gate: GJK simplex handling — `subdistance` + a flat-face end-to-end query.

Two defects lived in the routine this file was written against, both silent and
both reachable from ordinary geometry:

  1. FLAT SIMPLEX READ AS AN ENCLOSURE. The outside test was the bare product
     `dot_opp * dot_origin < 0`. For a COPLANAR quadruple every face has
     dot_opp == 0 exactly, so no face is ever flagged, and the routine falls
     through to "origin is inside the tetrahedron" — v = 0, which `gjk_epa`
     reads as penetration. GJK converges onto a planar facet whenever the
     closest feature is one (a hull face parallel to a box or cylinder cap), so
     this is the common case, not a tie: it invented contacts between geoms
     centimetres apart. It cost the SawyerReach mesh gate its meaning — that
     gate's "obj teleported into the gripper hull" pose is 15.1 mm CLEAR of the
     hull, and the contact it asserted was fabricated.

  2. ALIASED REDUCTION. Reducing to the winning face copied slot-by-slot in
     place. Face ADB is (i0,i1,i2) = (0,27,9): slot 1 is overwritten with D and
     then read back as "B", retaining {A,D,D}. A degenerate simplex stalls the
     next iteration.

⚠⚠ THE SUBJECT MOVED AND THE DEFECTS DID NOT. `_closest_point_on_simplex` is
gone; the faithful port of `subdistance` / `S1D` / `S2D` / `S3D` (Montanari et
al, ToG 2017) took its place, and it has a DIFFERENT CONTRACT: it returns
`lambda` alone and never touches the simplex, and the CALLER drops the vertices
whose coordinate is exactly zero, in order. So:

  * defect 1 is still exactly testable — "reported as an enclosure" is now
    "every one of the four `lambda` is non-zero", which is `S3D`'s
    `comp1 && comp2 && comp3 && comp4` arm;
  * defect 2 is STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE now rather than merely fixed, because
    nothing reduces the simplex inside the routine at all. What this file can
    still pin is the half that decides the reduction — WHICH coordinate comes
    back zero — and it does, because that choice is what `polytope2/3/4` seeds
    EPA from.

⚠ The closest point is `lincomb(lambda, simplex)`, computed here rather than
returned, which is also how `gjk_epa_witness` spells it.

⚠ THE SIMPLEX LIVES IN THE `ccd_ws` ROW, not on the stack — see
`ccd_workspace.mojo`. These fixtures write it through `set_sv` for the same
reason the engine does.
