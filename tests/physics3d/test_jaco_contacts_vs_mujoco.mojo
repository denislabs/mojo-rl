"""Jaco's CONTACT SET against MuJoCo — the prerequisite for collision rejection.

The last piece of the dm_control Phase 7 reset path is
`ToolCenterPointInitializer`'s rejection sampler, which accepts an IK solution
only if `_has_relevant_collisions` says no. That predicate reads the contact
set directly — geom pairs and `contact.dist` — so wiring it on top of an
unmeasured contact set would put an accept/reject decision on numbers nobody
has checked.

⚠ JACO'S COLLISION PATH HAS NEVER RUN. The mesh-inertia gate that landed
earlier in Phase 7 is MODEL-ONLY; it never called collision detection, so the
9 mesh hulls have never been through narrow phase on this model. This file
exists to find out where we actually stand before anything depends on it.

WHAT JACO CONTAINS, measured on the runtime over 400 random in-range poses:
1 plane, 6 cylinders, 14 meshes; 25% of poses collide, mean ncon 6.4, max 48.
The type-pair histogram is plane-mesh 1868, plane-cylinder 503, mesh-mesh 106,
cylinder-mesh 86, cylinder-cylinder 8. So plane-mesh dominates and mesh-mesh
is real but rarer.

⚠ THE GROUND COUNTS. `_has_relevant_collisions` treats any external body
WITHOUT a free joint as relevant, and the arena's plane is exactly that — so
arm-versus-ground contacts decide rejections just as much as self-collisions
do. A gate that only exercised self-collision would miss the dominant case.

COMPARED AT BODY LEVEL, NOT GEOM LEVEL. Our contact record stores
`body_a`/`body_b`, not geom ids (`CONTACT_IDX_BODY_A`). That is enough for the
predicate, which classifies a geom by which entity owns it — a body property —
and it avoids having to establish a geom index mapping on top of everything
else.

THIS TEST FOUND TWO DEFECTS, BOTH NOW FIXED. What it measured first:

    total contacts     ours 3311   MuJoCo 433     (~7.6x over-generation)
    worst single pose  ours 256    MuJoCo 24      (256 IS OUR BUFFER CAP)
    penetrating body-pairs   both 53, ours-only 0, MUJOCO-ONLY 78

1. `_plane_mesh_contacts` emitted ONE CONTACT PER HULL VERTEX below the plane,
   unbounded. `mjc_PlaneConvex` emits AT MOST THREE (`maxplanemesh = 3`): the
   support point in -normal, plus up to two vertices from ITS HULL-EDGE
   NEIGHBOURHOOD passing `addplanemesh`'s spread filter, which rejects
   `dist3(pnt, first) < tolplanemesh * rbound`, `tolplanemesh = 0.3`. Both
   constants are identical in the 3.3.6, 3.6.0 and 3.11.0 trees.
2. `geom_rbound` for a mesh measured from the VERTEX CENTROID, where MuJoCo
   uses the AABB corner radius about the frame origin (`mjCGeom::GetRBound`).
   Ours spanned 0.72x to 1.16x of MuJoCo's across Jaco's nine meshes. Only the
   first fix made this observable: `rbound` scales the spread filter, so it
   decides how many contacts a plane-mesh pair emits.

⚠⚠ THE OVER-GENERATION WAS CAUSING THE MISSING PAIRS, AS SUSPECTED. This was
recorded here as unproven — "not independent evidence of a second bug until
the count is fixed and this is re-measured" — and the re-measurement settled
it: with the cap in place `mujoco-only` went 78 -> 0 with no other change. One
plane-mesh pair had been flooding the buffer before other pairs were reached,
so a COUNT bug presented as MISSING COLLISIONS.

AFTER (same 60 poses): totals ours 436 vs MuJoCo 433, per-pose counts equal on
58/60, body-pairs both 131 with ours-only 0 AND mujoco-only 0.

⚠ THE RESIDUAL IS NOT ZERO, AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE. MuJoCo picks its two
extra contacts in qhull's internal facet order, which nothing here reproduces,
and our hull differs from qhull's on one of the nine meshes (199 vertices
against 198). Counts survive that — they depend only on the candidate SET —
but the two poses that still differ are t=43 (+4, plane-mesh dominated: 15 of
MuJoCo's 23 contacts there) and t=20 (-1, only 2 plane-mesh contacts of 23, so
it lives in the cylinder-mesh / mesh-mesh paths instead). Both have IDENTICAL
body-pair sets, which is what the rejection sampler reads.

WHAT IS ASSERTED: body FK (a hard precondition), that we neither invent nor
miss a penetrating body-pair, the ANY-penetration predicate the sampler
reduces to, that no pose comes near the contact-buffer cap, and contact counts
against MuJoCo's — the last three added once the defects above were fixed.

⚠ THE COUNT BOUNDS CARRY HEADROOM RATHER THAN TODAY'S EXACT NUMBERS. Freezing
58/60 and 436 would make this fail on any hull-triangulation change, including
a correct one, while telling nobody what actually moved. The bounds are set to
catch a return of the 7.6x over-generation, not to pin the residual.
