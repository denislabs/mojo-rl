"""`ray/mesh.mojo` vs `mj_rayMesh` — rays at a NON-CONVEX mesh.

    pixi run mojo run -I . tests/physics3d/test_ray_mesh_vs_mujoco.mojo

⚠⚠ THE FIXTURE HAS TO BE NON-CONVEX OR THIS FILE PROVES NOTHING. The triangle
store (`Model.mesh_tris`) exists only because `Model.mesh_verts` is the convex
HULL and a ray aimed into a cutout must find the hole. On a convex mesh the
hull IS the mesh, so a `ray_mesh` that quietly walked hull triangles — or a
`ray_mesh` on a model whose soup was never populated but whose hull was —
would agree with MuJoCo on every ray. Every other STL fixture in
`tests/physics3d/assets/` is convex (a cube, a hex prism, an n-gon prism), so
`notch.stl` was added for this: a box with a slot cut in its top face.

`test_the_fixture_is_not_convex` is the standing guard, and it is not a
formality — it asserts the two rays that separate the surfaces:

    straight down the SLOT  ->  z = -0.010   (the slot floor)
    straight down the LID   ->  z = +0.040   (the top face)

A hull would answer +0.040 for BOTH. If those ever agree, the fixture has
stopped being non-convex and the sweep below is measuring nothing.

⚠ `half_extents` WAS AN OPEN QUESTION THIS FILE ANSWERED, and the answer used
to be "a placeholder". `mj_rayMesh` rejects on `geom_size` before touching a
triangle (engine_ray.c:894, :963); MuJoCo stores
`max(|aamm[k]|, |aamm[k+3]|)` there — [0.0423, 0.05, 0.05] for this notch, not
symmetric, because a mesh is recentred on its centre of mass — and our parser
stored 0.5. That was harmless at 5 cm and wrong on any mesh reaching past half
a metre from its frame origin, where every hit beyond that came back as a
MISS. Fixed 2026-09-13 (AUD-46): `fields_build` derives it from the loaded
hull vertices with the same scan `compute_mesh_rbound_at` uses, and
`test_our_mesh_box_equals_mujocos` now asserts the equality rather than the
inequality that was all the placeholder could support.

WHAT THIS GATE WAS PROVEN ABLE TO FAIL
======================================
    injected defect                            caught by       |dt|
    ----------------------------------------   -------------   ---------
    negative triangle distances accepted        hits 454->103   0.21
    normal not rotated out of the local frame   |dnormal| 1.81  UNCHANGED
    ---
    the bounding-box reject removed             NOTHING         UNCHANGED

⚠ THE LAST ROW IS A CONFIRMED PREDICTION, NOT A HOLE. Removing the reject
cannot change an answer — it only skips a rejection — and since our box
over-approximates, it never rejected a real hit in the first place. Identical
output is what should happen; it is recorded so nobody reads the reject as
untested and tightens it without re-measuring.
