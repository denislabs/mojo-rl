"""The Euler integrator's GPU step against its CPU step on a model with joint
damping — the gate for `_finalize_rhs_kernel` and the four-launch finalize
(`EULER_FINALIZE_SPLIT`).

⚠ NOT BIT-EXACT, AND THE REASON IS ON RECORD. The CPU step takes
`_finalize_tree_env` on a model with a tree table, whose docstring says it
is "not bit-exact against the dense twin: a different rounding of the same
M_hat^-1 (M qacc)"; the GPU step is the dense twin. Measured on this fixture
the two legs differ at 11 of 12 values by at most 2^-20 (1.49e-06 at
|qpos| ~ 1.6) — with the OLD single-launch kernel and with the split, the
same values and the same worst digit, which is what says the split is the
old kernel's arithmetic. The bound below is 1e-5 absolute: two decades
above that rounding, five decades below what a halved damping does (0.32).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The finalize's implicit damping (`M_hat = M +
dt*diag(damping)`, `mj_Euler`'s eulerdamp) runs only when a dof has damping,
and the two gates that were green while a mutant halved that damping did not
reach it: `test_tape_gpu_parity` never steps the physics, and
`test_ip_fields_env_loop` compares at 1e-2. This one steps the inverted
pendulum (`damping="1"` on both joints, no meshes) on both targets from the
same state under the same forces and demands `qpos` and `qvel` within the
tree/dense rounding, and it asserts the damping is non-zero so it cannot go vacuous by a
model edit.
