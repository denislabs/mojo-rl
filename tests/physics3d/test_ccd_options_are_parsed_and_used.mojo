"""`<option ccd_tolerance= ccd_iterations=>` — parsed, stored, AND consumed.

EPA's stopping rule used to be hardcoded at 1e-8 / 64 iterations. MuJoCo's are
`mjOption.ccd_tolerance` = 1e-6 and `.ccd_iterations` = 35, and a model that
set either was ignored outright. This gates the whole path:

  1. `parse_xml` (COMPTIME counter) reads both, and defaults to MuJoCo's when
     the attributes are absent;
  2. `<option>` values survive into model META, which is where the narrow
     phase reads them from — the RUNTIME parser, which is a different parser
     (`feedback_physics3d_two_parser_paths`);
  3. changing `ccd_tolerance` CHANGES A CONTACT. Without this the first two
     are satisfied by dead data: a value can be parsed and stored and read by
     nothing, which is exactly what `<geom solref>` did for months.

⚠⚠ 3 IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CANNOT BE FAKED, and it is deliberately asserted as
an INEQUALITY on a quantity, not as a frozen number. A golden here would pin
whatever EPA happens to produce at two tolerances and would go on passing if
the tolerance stopped reaching the solver — the assertion has to be "these two
differ", because that is the claim.

⚠ THE FIXTURE MUST BE A SMOOTH PAIR. `discreteGeoms` sends mesh/box/hfield
pairs (at zero margin, in double precision) to `mjMINVAL` instead, so
`ccd_tolerance` provably does nothing there — a mesh-vs-box fixture would
assert "changing the tolerance changes the answer" against code that ignores
it, and fail for the right reason but the wrong lesson. A CYLINDER against a box
is smooth on one side, which is enough, and needs no mesh asset.

# MuJoCo 3.10.0 on the same cylinder/box pose, `mj_forward`: 3 contacts, all at

#
#     <geom name="g_box" type="box" size="0.05 0.04 0.03"/>
#     <body pos="0.030 0.020 0.038" quat="0.83 0.29 0.41 0.24">

#     </body>
#
# ⚠⚠ AND NOTE THE TWO THINGS MuJoCo DOES TO THAT FILE BEFORE EPA SEES IT,
# BECAUSE THIS TEST HAND-BUILDS THE CALL AND SO HAS TO DO THEM ITSELF:
#
#   1. IT NORMALIZES THE QUATERNION. `0.83 0.29 0.41 0.24` has norm 0.9993498,
#      and `mjCModel` stores the unit version in `geom_quat`. A non-unit
#      quaternion is not a rotation — it builds a SCALED matrix — so passing
#      the literal poses a different cylinder than the one this number
#      describes. In production `gjk_epa` never sees one: the world quaternion
#      it is given comes out of `forward_kinematics`, which normalizes (see
#      `gpu_quat_normalize`), which is exactly why the routine does not
#      normalize defensively on a per-call hot path.
#
#   2. IT ORDERS THE PAIR (CYLINDER, BOX), NOT (BOX, CYLINDER). `mj_forward`
#      reports `geom1 = 1` (the cylinder, `mjGEOM_CYLINDER` = 5) and
#      `geom2 = 0` (the box, `mjGEOM_BOX` = 6): `pushPairArena` sorts by
#      `mjtGeom` id, which is what `mj_geom_type_rank` mirrors. Our EPA is not
#      symmetric under the swap either — see the measurements below.
#
# ⚠⚠ THIS TEST PASSED FOR TWELVE DAYS WITH BOTH OF THEM WRONG, ON A
# COINCIDENCE. Measured against this constant, `ccd_tolerance` 1e-6:
#
#     tree         order     quat          |d - mj|
#     353696b4     BOX,CYL   raw           7.610e-06   <- passed, budget 1e-5
#     353696b4     BOX,CYL   normalized    1.363e-07
#     HEAD         BOX,CYL   raw           4.673e-05   <- the red
#     HEAD         BOX,CYL   normalized    2.544e-08
#     HEAD         CYL,BOX   normalized    0.0         <- what we assert now
#
# (The last row is 0.0 computing the unit quaternion at run time; from the
# rounded decimal literals below it lands ONE ULP away, 3.5e-18.)
#
# ⚠ THE NORMAL CAME ALONG WITH THE ORDER, WHICH IS THE CORROBORATION. `gjk_epa`
# returns geom1 -> geom2, so asking (CYLINDER, BOX) asks MuJoCo's question:
# ours is now (-2.711e-06, -3.378e-06, -0.99999999999) against MuJoCo's
# `contact.frame[0:3]` = (-0.000003, -0.000003, -1.000000), SIGN INCLUDED,
# where the (BOX, CYLINDER) call returned it pointing the other way. That is
# about the argument order at THIS call, not about
# `_our_contact_normal_is_the_negation_of_mjcontacts`, which is a separate open
# item about how the `Contact` RECORD is built (`body_b -> body_a`).
#
# Read the middle column: with the RIGHT inputs the engine went 1.363e-07 ->
# 0.0 over that span, i.e. the EPA work (`fee37034`, `d67673df`) moved it ONTO
# the reference. What it also did was move our answer for the SKEWED pose to
# that pose's own correct answer, which is 4.7e-05 from the answer for a
# different pose — so the fixture's error stopped being masked. The failure
# was the gate asking one question and comparing against another's answer, and
# a budget loose enough to hide the difference.
