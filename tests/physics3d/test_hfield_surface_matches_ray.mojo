"""The surface the VIEWER draws is the surface the RAYS hit.

`mj_rayHfield` builds a heightfield's triangles for the physics; `draw_heightfield`
builds them for the screen. The two spell the same convention, and if they ever
stop agreeing the failure is silent and bad in a specific way: the viewer exists
to answer "is the model built and posed the way I think", so a drawn surface
half a cell off, or transposed in row/column, looks entirely plausible while
quietly contradicting the terrain the robot stands on.

WHAT THIS GATES. `hfield_surface.mojo` is where the sample positions are
spelled ONCE, and `draw_heightfield` calls it. This file drops a vertical ray
onto nodes computed from THOSE functions and asserts `mj_rayHfield` comes back
at that node's height. Renderer formula in, ray answer out — so a divergence
between the two is a test failure rather than a rendering curiosity.

⚠ VERTICAL RAYS ONLY, AND FROM ABOVE. A node is a shared corner of up to four
triangles, so a grazing ray there is a genuine edge case the reference itself
resolves arbitrarily; straight down hits the interior of a triangle whose
corner is the node, which is unambiguous. The oblique cases are already gated
against MuJoCo by `test_quadruped_escape_vs_dm_control`.

⚠ NON-VACUITY IS THE POINT OF THE SPREAD CHECK. Escape's terrain is a bowl and
its centre is nearly flat; a sweep confined to the middle would compare a
constant against a constant and pass with the row and column swapped. The nodes
below deliberately straddle the rim, and the test ASSERTS the heights it
sampled actually vary before it believes the agreement.
