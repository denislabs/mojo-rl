"""`ray/hfield.mojo` vs `mj_rayHfield` — rays at a real 8x8 elevation grid.

    pixi run mojo run -I . tests/physics3d/test_ray_hfield_vs_mujoco.mojo

Both sides read the SAME model string, and the grid our side walks is OUR
`Model.hfield_data` — not a copy of MuJoCo's. That the two grids agree is
`test_hfield_vs_mujoco::test_the_elevation_grid_matches_mjmodel`'s job and is
asserted here again as a precondition, because a ray gate that silently walked
a different surface would report a ray defect for a parse one.

⚠⚠ THE HFIELD GEOM IS DELIBERATELY NOT AT THE ORIGIN. It carries a `pos` and
an `euler`, and the reason is the defect this session already paid for once: a
camera composition was invisible for the entire port because every camera sat
on the worldbody, where the transform is the identity. A heightfield at the
origin with no rotation makes `ray_map` the identity too, and every frame error
in `ray_hfield` — the two box offsets along the field's own +z, the normal
rotated back out at the end — would read as exact.

WHAT THIS GATE WAS PROVEN ABLE TO FAIL, AND THE ONE THING IT CANNOT SEE
=======================================================================
Defects injected into `ray/hfield.mojo` one at a time:

  injected defect                             caught by         |dt|
  -----------------------------------------   ---------------   --------
  the four side walls (stage 4) removed        7 splits         0.96
  second triangle's winding swapped            |dnormal| 1.88   UNCHANGED
  segment starts at the box entry, not 0       8 splits         1.04
  the base box's hit discarded                33 splits         0.77
  cell window shrunk by one cell each side    15 splits         1.08
  ---
  the reference's `+-1` cell PADDING removed   NOTHING           UNCHANGED

⚠ THE LAST ROW IS A STATED LIMIT, NOT A PASS. Removing the padding changes no
answer here, while shrinking the window by one cell is caught immediately — so
the window is TIGHT (the sweep does reach cells at its boundary) and the extra
padded cell is simply slack on a 1 m field of 8x8 cells, where one cell is
14 cm. The padding is in the reference for a surface that rises to meet the ray
outside the box footprint, which needs a finer grid than this asset to produce.
**Nothing here gates it.** Do not read the green as covering it.

⚠ FOUR RAY FAMILIES, AND THE HORIZONTAL ONE IS THE POINT. `mj_rayHfield` has
four stages and the last — the four vertical SIDES of the top box — only fires
for a ray that arrives at the terrain from the side, passing under no triangle
at all. That is precisely what `quadruped escape`'s rangefinders are: twenty
horizontal rays from a body standing on the terrain. A sweep of downward rays
covers stages 1-3 and leaves the stage this feature exists for untested.
The per-family hit counts are printed so that stays visible.
