"""`ctrlrange` is only applied when the actuator is `ctrllimited`.

`apply_actions` clamped every actuator's `ctrl` to `motor_ctrl_min/max`
unconditionally, and those FALL BACK TO (-1, 1) when no level of the model
supplies a `ctrlrange`. So an actuator MuJoCo leaves unclamped had its command
silently squeezed into +-1.

⚠ `ctrllimited` DEFAULTS TO "auto", NOT TO FALSE. The absent attribute means
"limited iff a range was defined", which is why the missing check is invisible
on any model that declares ranges — and every model in this tree does.
Measured against the 3.10.0 runtime with `qfrc_actuator` at `ctrl = 5.0`:

    <motor/>                                      limited 0  [0, 0]   +5.0
    <motor ctrlrange="-1 1"/>                     limited 1  [-1, 1]  +1.0
    <motor ctrlrange="-2 3"/>                     limited 1  [-2, 3]  +3.0
    <motor ctrlrange="0 0"/>                      limited 0  [0, 0]   +5.0
    <motor ctrlrange="-1 1" ctrllimited="false"/> limited 0  [-1, 1]  +5.0
    <motor ctrllimited="false"/>                  limited 0  [0, 0]   +5.0

(`ctrllimited="true"` with no range is a COMPILE ERROR in MuJoCo — "invalid
control range for actuator" — so limited-with-zero-range is unrepresentable
and this file does not test it. Same as `forcelimited`.)

⚠⚠ WHY NOTHING HERE CAUGHT IT, AND WHY IT STILL MATTERS. Measured across the
31 dm_control + Gymnasium reference models: **0 of 254 actuators are
unlimited** — default classes supply a ctrlrange everywhere, so the guard was
dead code on every model this engine has ever run. It is NOT dead on the
models being ported now: **423 of Menagerie's 2244 actuators are unlimited**,
and ToddlerBot is **30 of 30** on every variant. Its actuators are
`<position>`, whose `ctrl` is a target ANGLE, over joints ranging to 18.5 rad
— so that robot could not have been commanded past 1 radian, on any joint.

⚠ A GREP CANNOT MEASURE THIS. Scanning actuator tags for a missing
`ctrlrange` reports dog and quadruped as unlimited; both inherit ranges from a
`class="..."` default and are fully limited. Every count above comes from
loading the model and reading `m.actuator_ctrllimited`.

TWO CLAMP SITES, both gated here: `apply_actions` (CPU) and
`apply_actions_kernel_gpu`. Both were unconditional, and fixing one alone
would have left the two targets computing different forces from the same
action — the shape of defect #54.
