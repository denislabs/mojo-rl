"""`<equality><connect>` — mjEQ_CONNECT, BODY and SITE semantics.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Until 2026-08-12 `_fill_equality` RAISED on `<connect>`
rather than parsing it, because `anchor_b` — MuJoCo's `eq_data[3:6]`, the
shared anchor expressed in body2's frame — was never populated, so body2 would
have been anchored at its own origin. That raise was the right call (loud beats
latent) but it left every model with a connect unloadable, ToddlerBot included.

TWO HALVES, BOTH REQUIRED. MJCF spells a connect two mutually exclusive ways
and `mj_instantiateEquality` (engine_core_constraint.c:448) branches on
`eq_objtype`:

  BODY:  pos[j] = xpos[body_j] + xmat[body_j] * eq_data[3j : 3j+3]
         `eq_data[0:3]` is the MJCF `anchor` (body1's frame); `eq_data[3:6]`
         is DERIVED at qpos0 by `mj_setConst`.
  SITE:  pos[j] = site_xpos[site_j], bodies from `site_bodyid`, and
         `eq_data` is zeroed and never read.

We store the site form REDUCED to the body form — `(site_bodyid, site local
pos)` — because FK defines `site_xpos = xpos[b] + xmat[b] * site_pos`, which
is the same expression. That leaves the row builder and every solver path
untouched, and is why this file gates the two spellings against each other as
well as against MuJoCo.

⚠ THE DERIVATION IS SKIPPED ON THE SITE FORM and would otherwise overwrite
site2's offset with an anchor MuJoCo never computes.
`test_site_connect_leaves_eq_data_alone` is what catches that: it pins both
anchor slots to the two sites' local `pos`, which a leaked derivation moves.

WHY THIS FIXTURE. The bob's only support is the connect — no floor, both geoms
have `contype=0 conaffinity=0`, no limits, no springs. Nothing else in the
engine can hold it up, so "held" and "free fall" are metres apart rather than a
tolerance argument. `arm` carries a 45-degree `quat` so that `R_b^T` in the
anchor derivation is NOT the identity: with an axis-aligned body2 the whole
derivation degenerates to a subtraction and a transposed rotation that is never
applied would pass.

⚠ ROWS, NOT A LONG ROLLOUT — and the horizon below is short DELIBERATELY.
Measured ours-vs-MuJoCo |d(qpos)|_inf on the BODY fixture:

    step    1     1.6e-18      <- bit-exact
    step    2     9.1e-09      <- the iterative solve's own tolerance
    step    5     4.0e-07
    step   10     5.4e-06
    step   20     6.0e-05
    step   60     2.7e-03
    step  240     3.6e-01

Step 1 is exact and step 2 lands on MuJoCo's default solver tolerance (1e-8);
everything after is that seed amplified geometrically by a swinging pendulum.
Lengthening `NSTEPS_ROLL` therefore measures Lyapunov growth, not the
constraint, and no tolerance that "fixes" a longer horizon means anything.
`efc_J` / `efc_aref` / `efc_D` are pose-local and exact — they are what says
the rows are right. The rollout only proves the constraint is wired into the
integrator at all.
