"""AUD-41 — a pose transmission cannot reach the GPU leg by accident.

    pixi run -e apple mojo run -I . tests/physics3d/test_site_transmission_gpu_is_unserved.mojo

`apply_actions_kernel_gpu` walks a transmission stored as `(qadr, dadr, coef)`
triples. A `<motor site=>` has none — its moment is `jac^T · (R_site · gear)`,
a function of the POSE — and neither does a `<motor tendon=>` naming a
SPATIAL tendon. Both leave `trn_n = 0`, so the kernel has nothing to walk and
the actuator would keep its slot in `nact`, consume its control and apply
ZERO FORCE. On the CPU leg `pose_transmission.apply_pose_transmission`
supplies it.

⚠⚠ THE AUDIT RECORDED THIS AS "BATCHED ENVS GET ZERO FORCE FROM THOSE
ACTUATORS", AND THAT IS ONLY HALF TRUE. `ModelDefFromXML` — the comptime
model the batched GPU env is built from — REFUSES `trn_n == 0` at build
(`model_def_from_xml.mojo:1278`). A pose transmission therefore cannot reach
the GPU path silently at all: it raises, by name, unless the caller passes
`allow_unsupported_actuators=True`, whose own contract is "this env's CONFIG
drives the DOF itself". The silent-zero reading of AUD-41 requires someone to
open that hatch and then not drive the dof. Test one below is that guard;
tests two and three are what is behind it.

WHO IS EXPOSED. Across `noeira/envs` and `noeira/tasks` — the only trees
that reach the batched GPU path — there is exactly one `<spatial>` tendon
(`ball_in_cup.xml`) and it is a LIMIT, not a transmission; no actuator has a
`site=`; none is `<adhesion>`. quadruped's eight tendon actuators drive
`<fixed>` tendons, which ARE walked as triples. Every model that needs this
one (tetheria's hands, skydio_x2, bitcraze_crazyflie_2, fruitfly) is a
Menagerie scene driven by the CPU studio or the validation sweep, where the
transmission is served in full.

⚠⚠ THE CONTROL ARM IS WHAT MAKES THE ZERO EVIDENCE. "The GPU qfrc is all
zero" is also exactly what a kernel that never launched looks like. The
fixture therefore carries a SECOND actuator, an ordinary `<motor joint=>` on
a child hinge, whose dof the kernel must drive correctly in the same call.
Dofs 0..5 are the free joint, reachable only through the site wrench; dof 6
is the hinge, reachable only through the joint motor. One launch, two
verdicts.

⚠ `gravity="0 0 0"`. `qfrc_actuator` is then the actuation alone, so a
nonzero reading cannot be weight leaking in.
