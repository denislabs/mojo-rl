"""The batched camera tracer on the GPU against the same code on the CPU.

    pixi run mojo run -I . tests/physics3d/test_camera_render_gpu_vs_cpu.mojo

⚠⚠ THIS IS `test_ray_model_gpu_vs_cpu`'S ARGUMENT ONE LAYER UP, AND IT IS NOT A
FORMALITY. `raytrace/` is ONE implementation over `LayoutTensor` so a kernel and
the host run the same code — and "the same code" is what Metal has silently
miscompiled four times in this engine, always the same way: a per-thread array
indexed by a RUNTIME value reads back wrong, with no crash and no diagnostic
(`87960e10`). The camera adds a whole new opportunity for one — a frame is
three axis vectors and a position, which is exactly the thing somebody would
reach for a nine-element array for. This gate is what says nobody did.

⚠ float32 ON BOTH LEGS. Metal rejects `double`, so the CPU control is built at
float32 too; comparing a float32 GPU answer against a float64 CPU answer would
report the DTYPE as a GPU defect.

⚠ THREE CHANNELS ARE COMPARED, NOT ONE. `seg` is the sharpest of the three and
the reason is measured, not assumed: three of the five defects `ray_model` was
falsified against left the hit DISTANCE untouched and showed only as a
different geom. A colour-only comparison would have passed all three.

⚠ AND THE VACUITY GUARDS ARE LOAD-BEARING. "0 mismatching pixels" and "the
camera renders empty sky" are the same number. Every test below prints what it
COMPARED beside what DIFFERED, and asserts on the former.
