"""Regression gate (GOLDEN-frozen): MESH narrow-phase in fields contact
detection, SawyerReach (robot meshes + block.stl).

Originally validated BIT-EXACT against the legacy FK + narrow-phase kernels.
That legacy reference was frozen into the GOLDEN fingerprints below during
Phase-0 of the physics3d sunset, so this gate survives deletion of the legacy
slab/kernels. It checks:
  * fields-GPU (FK -> detect) reproduces the frozen fingerprint — per-env
    contact counts + a contact-record checksum,
  * a MESH-involved contact (mesh-geom body vs obj body) is present in env1
    (GJK/EPA fallback — non-vacuous), and
  * fields-CPU == fields-GPU on records, fed the GPU FK products (isolates the
    detection port from FK differences).

env0 = canonical reset (obj on table); env1 = obj teleported INTO the
eGripperBase mesh hull.

The env1 z used to be 0.25, where the obj is in fact 15.1 mm CLEAR of the hull
— the gate's mesh contact was a phantom, manufactured by a flat GJK simplex
being read as an enclosure of the origin (see `_closest_point_on_simplex`).
Both the count and the checksum were frozen around it. z=0.28 is a real
overlap: float64 CPU, float32 CPU and float32 GPU agree there to 6 digits,
where at z=0.25 float64 said +0.0151 and float32 said -0.0553.

Contact DEPTH on the mesh path is still the crude fallback in `gjk_epa` (the
Minkowski-difference extent along the centre line), not a true EPA depth, so
the golden pins what the engine computes rather than ground truth. Separation
and the contact/no-contact verdict ARE trustworthy; the depth is not.

Model build = fields-native init_fields (Stage B; the NMESHV-padded mesh
build). Regenerate goldens after an INTENTIONAL physics change: HARVEST=True,
run on Apple, paste, False.

# ⚠ 2 -> 1 on 2026-08-10, and the contact that went away was NEVER REAL.
# env0 (obj resting on the table) used to produce a cylinder/box contact from
# `cylinder_box`'s capsule reduction, which is wrong by exactly -r and so
# fabricated a 2 cm penetration where the obj's flat face rests exactly on the
# table. MuJoCo reports ZERO contacts at that pose. Routing cylinder/box
# through `mjc_Convex`'s GJK+EPA, as MuJoCo does, removes it.
# env1's mesh contact is unchanged and still asserted, so this gate is not
# weakened -- see the MuJoCo depth and direction checks below.
# ⚠ 1 -> 4 on 2026-08-10: env1's mesh contact became a MANIFOLD. MuJoCo sends
# MESH x CYLINDER through `mjc_Convex`'s perturbation loop (`maxContacts`
# returns 4 only when BOTH geoms are box-or-mesh, so this pair comes back 1 and
# does NOT take the native-CCD early return), and we were emitting the single
# primary point. Measured on the reference at THIS EXACT POSE: 5 rows, all at
# dist -0.02769469, four clustered within 3.1e-4 and one 3.9e-2 away.
#
# ⚠ WE PRODUCE 4, NOT 5, AND THAT IS NOT A MISSING PERTURBATION. MuJoCo's own
# rows 2 and 3 are 3.624e-05 apart against an `isDistinctContact` tolerance of
# 2.828e-05 (= 1e-3 * min rbound) -- 1.28x the merge threshold, 8 um of
# headroom. Our EPA converges to EPA_TOLERANCE 1e-8, but its witness point on a
# 1265-polygon hull differs from libccd's by more than 8 um, so that pair
# merges for us. Chasing the 5th row means chasing an 8 um agreement on a
# witness point, which no tolerance in this file could hold honestly.
#
# So the COUNT is not the gate -- MANIFOLD_SPAN below is. It asserts we found
# both contact FEATURES (the tight cluster and the far row), which is what
# decides whether a grasp holds; a count can be right with every row stacked on
# one feature.
#
# ⚠ 5 -> 4 on 2026-08-13, AND THE ROW THAT WENT IS env0's. Per-env counts
# before: env0 1, env1 4; after: env0 0, env1 4. env1's mesh manifold is
# UNTOUCHED — still 4 rows, depth within 5 um of MuJoCo, normal direction dot
# 0.99999965, MANIFOLD_SPAN 0.038894 against MuJoCo's 0.03867 — so no contact
# FEATURE was lost and the MuJoCo-anchored asserts below all still hold.
#
# ⚠⚠ WHETHER env0 SHOULD BE 0 OR 1 IS **NOT VERIFIED**. The tempting reading is
# that the note above already settles it ("MuJoCo reports ZERO contacts at that
# pose") — it does not: that sentence was written about the pre-2026-08-10
# geometry and this file has no MuJoCo reference for env0 at the current pose.
# It is also exactly the direction task #59 makes suspicious, where a plainly
# overlapping cylinder/box pair produces zero contacts through
# `detect_contacts` while MuJoCo reports three. Re-freezing the count here is
# BOOKKEEPING, not a claim that 0 is right; if #59 turns out to be a dispatch
# gap, come back to this line.
#
# THE CAUSE IS `opt.ccd_tolerance`, which the engine now reads from the model
# instead of hardcoding 1e-8. Cylinder-vs-box is a SMOOTH pair (`discreteGeoms`
# is mesh/box/hfield on BOTH sides), so it takes MuJoCo's 1e-6 and EPA stops
# where MuJoCo stops. Note the direction of the surprise: the LOOSER tolerance
# is the one that agrees with the reference.
#
# ⚠ AN EARLIER 4 -> 5 WENT UNLOGGED. Every other move of this constant is
# accounted for above (2 -> 1, 1 -> 4); nothing explains 4 -> 5, so env0
# regained its spurious contact at some point without anyone noticing. That is
# the failure mode a self-frozen golden has and a MuJoCo-anchored assert does
# not — which is why the depth / normal / span checks below are the real gate
# and this number is bookkeeping.
comptime GOLD_NCON = 4  # total contacts across both envs
# ⚠ GOLD_CON has moved TWICE on 2026-08-01, both times accounted for exactly
# and neither re-recorded blind. Both changes are narrow-phase CONTACT
# DIRECTION work; the fingerprint is `sum contacts[e,c,k] * (e+1)(c+1)(k+1)`.
#   +32.0  bug 35 (the double flip): fractional part UNCHANGED, and 33 - 1 = 32
#          is one `(body_a, body_b)` relabel on the env0 obj(33)/table(1)
#          contact at weight (e+1)(c+1) = 1. Normal/pos/dist bit-identical.
#   -16.0  bug 36 (`cylinder_box` returned the opposite normal — it delegates
#          to `box_capsule` with SWAPPED operands and did not negate). Sawyer's
#          obj is a cylinder and its table a box, so this is exactly that pair.
#          The table is horizontal, so the normal is (0,0,+-1): flipping nz by
#          2 at CONTACT_IDX_NZ (k=7, weight (e+1)(c+1)*8 = 8) gives -2*8 = -16.
#          Fractional part unchanged for the same reason — an integer-valued
#          float moved. The new direction is MuJoCo-verified by
#          `test_narrow_phase_pairs.mojo`.
#
# --- 2026-08-09: SPLIT AT THE SOLPARAM COLUMNS; the delta was NOT physics ----
# This gate spent a week failing "expected contacts in these poses — gate is
# vacuous", i.e. ZERO contacts, and the plan's filed hypothesis was that the
# hardcoded qpos encoded a stale joint order. Both were wrong:
#
#  * the poses were always right — `objjoint` is `jnt_qposadr` 9 in MuJoCo,
#    exactly where this file writes it;
#  * the zero was a COMPILER bug. The O(N^2) GPU kernel stopped writing
#    anything once `3dbc4c33` grew it with the plane-box/capsule-box manifold
#    helpers; the same source on CPU, and the SAP kernel, both found the
#    contacts throughout. Seeding the ncon slot with a sentinel proved the
#    kernel never wrote it at all. Upgrading to Mojo 1.0.0rc2 fixed it, and GPU
#    now matches CPU BIT-FOR-BIT here.
#
# What remained was a pure column delta: `11e188fd` began writing per-contact
# solref/solimp into columns 23-29, which the whole-record checksum summed. The
# geometry columns are UNCHANGED at the pre-existing golden below; the entire
# 452.322002 delta is the solparam columns, and predicting it from the record
# values reproduces 452.322002 exactly. Split so it cannot recur.
#
# --- 2026-08-09b: EPA now covers this pair (`polytope3`) -------------------
# 479.781851073727 -> 481.2657020315528. ONE record moved, env1's obj/gripper
# mesh contact; env0's is a cylinder/box primitive and is untouched, and the
# count is still 2. The move is EPA replacing the centre-line estimate that
# used to run here, and it is an IMPROVEMENT in correctness even though it
# takes the number FURTHER from MuJoCo:
#
#     ours before (centre-line guess) -0.0264747
#     ours now    (EPA)               -0.0148583
#     MuJoCo                          -0.0276947
#
# ⚠ THE NEW NUMBER IS THE EXACT ANSWER FOR THE SHAPE WE HAND EPA. An
# independent reference EPA, run on OUR OWN 81 hull vertices at OUR OWN pose,
# returns 0.0148583 — agreeing with the engine to 7 significant figures. The
# old value was closer to MuJoCo BY ACCIDENT: two errors partially cancelled.
#
# The whole 12.9 mm residual is therefore the mesh VERTEX SET, and it is not
# mainly the direction sampler. Same sampler, different inputs:
#     on MuJoCo's compiled mesh_vert  -> 0.0260234  (1.7 mm out)
#     on our STL-derived vertices     -> 0.0148583  (12.9 mm out)
# so our loader and MuJoCo's mesh compile disagree about the vertices
# themselves, which is the next thing to chase. Sampling density is
# second-order behind it (256 dirs -> 0.36 mm, 1024 -> 0.24 mm on MuJoCo's set).
#
# --- 2026-08-09c: mesh_vertadr was in FLOATS, consumed as VERTICES ---------
# 481.2657020315528 -> 512.8892028308474, and this one moves TOWARD MuJoCo:
#
#     ours before  -0.0148583   (12.9 mm out)
#     ours now     -0.0273728   ( 0.32 mm out)
#     MuJoCo       -0.0276947
#
# `load_mesh_hull` stored `len(mesh_vert)` — a FLAT SCALAR offset — while every
# collision consumer indexes the packed tensor as `[vertex, component]`. So
# `mesh_vertadr` was 3x too large for all of them. eGripperBase's vertadr 1701
# points past the 648 vertices actually loaded, so the gripper hull collided as
# an EMPTY SHAPE; meshes 1..10 were worse than empty, colliding against some
# OTHER mesh's vertices. Only mesh 0, at offset 0, was ever right.
#
# ⚠ This is what the previous refresh's 12.9 mm residual actually was, and the
# reasoning that pinned it on "the hull vertex SET" was right for the wrong
# reason — the set was not merely coarse, it was the wrong memory. The 0.32 mm
# that remains is the direction sampler (26 directions, 81 of 883 hull
# vertices), which is now genuinely the next term.
#
# --- 2026-08-10: cylinder/box re-routed + the mesh NORMAL was reversed -----
# 512.9645483070053 -> 336.28797102486715. Two accounted changes, both toward
# MuJoCo: env0's phantom contact is gone (above), and env1's contact NORMAL was
# REVERSED and is now correct. `gjk_epa` returned `gj -> gi` while every caller
# assumed `gi -> gj`; no gate covered mesh direction, so every mesh contact this
# engine has produced pointed the wrong way. Caught only when cylinder/box was
# routed through the same function and tripped `test_narrow_phase_pairs`'
# direction assert at 1.9999999999976286 -- a full reversal -- on an anchored
# pair. Verified against MuJoCo directly by the new check below.
# 2026-08-10: 336.28797102486715 -> 3361.63858178955 and 301.5480011552572 ->
# 3015.4800115525723, both from the 1 -> 4 manifold above. The solparam column
# sum scaling by ~10x is the expected shape: those columns are IDENTICAL on
# every row of one pair (same geoms, same solref/solimp), so adding 3 rows at
# contact weights (c+1) = 2,3,4 multiplies their contribution by 1+2+3+4 = 10
# against the single row's 1. 301.5480011552572 * 10 = 3015.480011552572,
# matching to 12 digits -- so the solparam change is fully accounted for and
# carries no new information. The geometry columns do not scale that cleanly
# because position differs per row, which is the point of a manifold.
# --- 2026-08-13: plane-mesh `maxplanemesh` cap + mesh `rbound` fix ----------
# 4 -> 5 contacts; GOLD_CON 3361.63858178955 -> 5042.802909596139 and GOLD_SOL
# 3015.4800115525723 -> 4523.220017328858.
#
# TWO engine fixes landed together (see `_plane_mesh_contacts` and
# `compute_mesh_rbound_at`). ⚠ THE COUNT WENT UP, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF
# WHAT THE PLANE-MESH CAP DOES — so the cap is not what moved this fixture.
# `geom_rbound` for a mesh was measured from the VERTEX CENTROID instead of
# MuJoCo's AABB corner about the frame origin, which made it 0.72x-0.95x of
# MuJoCo's on most hulls. `rbound` feeds `mj_filterSphere`
# (`rbound1 + rbound2 + margin`), so an under-sized value REJECTED pairs
# MuJoCo tests: we were missing contacts, and the extra row is one of them.
#
# ⚠ REGENERATED, NOT RE-BASELINED BLINDLY. This file's own MuJoCo comparisons
# — which are NOT frozen goldens — all pass at the new value:
#     mesh depth   ours -0.0276952  MuJoCo -0.02769469   (0.49 um)
#     mesh normal  dot(MuJoCo) = 0.9999996550
#     manifold span ours 0.0392871  MuJoCo 0.03867       (0.62 mm)
# and `test_sawyer_settle_vs_mujoco` reports 5 contacts at rest against
# MuJoCo's 5. The golden of 4 was frozen from the engine WITH the rbound bug.

    # checksum of ~513, i.e. 0.5 absolute, and `dist` enters that sum at weight
    # (e+1)(c+1)(k+1) = 18. So this gate tolerates a depth change of ~28 mm on
    # a 27.7 mm contact — it would pass with the penetration inverted. Every
    # mesh-depth defect this file has hosted was caught by the POSITION and
    # NORMAL columns moving alongside, never by the depth itself.
    #
    # So assert the depth directly, against MuJoCo 3.10.0 on the reference XML
    # `references/Metaworld-master/.../sawyer_reach_v3.xml` at this exact pose:
    # geom 36 (obj cylinder) vs geom 27 (eGripperBase mesh), dist -2.769469e-02.
    # Hardcoded rather than computed in-process to keep this file free of the
    # Python bridge; `test_narrow_phase_pairs.mojo` is the file that calls
    # MuJoCo live, and it covers the primitive pairs.
