"""2b.0's payoff test: ONE compiled LDL body, two providers, three models.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHY IT COMES BEFORE THE SWEEP
===================================================

Phase 2b converts ~120 shared declarations to `D: DimsLike` + `LM: Layout`
so that one body serves both legs (assessment §12.4). Everything about that
plan rests on three claims, and each is cheap to check on ONE kernel and
expensive to discover at declaration ninety:

  A. a runtime-dims provider drives the same body a comptime one does, and
     they agree numerically;
  B. `Layout.row_major[2]()` + `RuntimeLayout` is accepted by the same
     `LM: Layout` parameter that takes `Layout.row_major(BATCH, NV*NV)`;
  C. ONE instantiation serves models of DIFFERENT SIZE — the property that
     makes the dynamic leg worth having at all. A dynamic provider that
     still needed a rebuild per model would be pure cost.

⚠ (C) IS THE ONE THAT CANNOT BE FAKED BY ACCIDENT. (A) and (B) would both
pass if the compiler quietly specialised the "dynamic" arm on a constant —
which is exactly how the §12.3 layout probe first returned a meaningless
1.000 (the comptime aliases were being folded into the "dynamic" function).
So the dynamic arm here runs NV=7 and NV=5 through the same `DynDims`
type, and the two answers must differ from each other while each matches its
own static counterpart. `DynDims` now takes NO parameters at all, which makes
the claim sharper than it was: there is not even a cap left to specialise on.

Tolerance: f64 throughout, and the comparison is against a static arm that
runs the SAME source lines. §4.4 warns the dynamic leg cannot be assumed
bit-exact in general (a comptime bound changes FMA contraction), so the gate
is 1e-12 and the actual worst error is PRINTED — if it is ever exactly zero
that is information, not something to assert.
