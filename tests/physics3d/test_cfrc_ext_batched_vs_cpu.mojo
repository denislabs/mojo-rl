"""`gpu/cfrc_ext_gpu.compute_cfrc_ext` (batched) vs the CPU `rne_post` path.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `compute_cfrc_ext` is a SECOND implementation of `cfrc_ext`,
with different arithmetic from the CPU one — it rebuilds each body's subtree CoM
from `xipos` inside the kernel instead of reading `Data.subtree_com`. It runs on
every batched step and every batched reset, and **nothing reads its output**: a
grep of every env config finds `cfrc_ext` exactly once per file, always as a
hook PARAMETER declaration, never in an expression.

An unread second implementation is a correctness liability rather than a
performance one. It cannot be caught by any existing gate, it can rot silently,
and whoever eventually wires it up (Ant-v5's contact cost, or a touch-based
reward) will reasonably trust it. So it gets gated rather than deleted — the
capability is real and the arithmetic was validated against MuJoCo once.

WHY AGAINST THE CPU PATH AND NOT MUJOCO. `test_rne_post_sensors_vs_mujoco`
already pins the CPU `cfrc_ext` against MuJoCo at 6.5e-11 on this exact model
and pose. Diffing the batched one against the CPU one therefore gates it
against MuJoCo TRANSITIVELY, with no MuJoCo in this file at all — and it
compares the two implementations directly, which is the thing that can drift.

⚠ The two do NOT have to agree bit-for-bit: the CPU path reads
`Data.subtree_com` (accumulated by `compute_subtree_com`) while the kernel
rebuilds it from `xipos` and `body_mass`. Same quantity, different summation
order. The tolerance below is set from the measurement, not guessed.
