"""float32 GJK must not invent a contact between geoms that are centimetres apart.

    pixi run mojo run -I . tests/physics3d/test_gjk_float32_no_phantom_contacts.mojo

⚠ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT — the fixture meshes are addressed by repo-root
relative path.

WHAT WENT WRONG. GJK's stopping test is

    |v| - s.v̂  <  GJK_TOLERANCE          (`GJK_TOLERANCE = 1e-10`)

MuJoCo's equivalent threshold is 0 for mesh pairs — `engine_collision_gjk.c`
says "if both geoms are discrete, finite convergence is guaranteed; set
tolerance to 0" — and that guarantee is an EXACT-ARITHMETIC one. At float64 it
effectively holds. At float32 the left-hand side is a difference of two dot
products of magnitude |v|, so its rounding floor is about `1e-7 * |v|` — for
robot-scale geometry, hundreds of times ABOVE 1e-10. The test can then never
fire, GJK runs to `GJK_MAX_ITERATIONS`, and what it returns after the cap is
not a converged distance.

⚠⚠ THE FAILURE IS NOT A SMALL ERROR, IT IS AN INVENTED CONTACT. Measured over
the 256-pose sweep below, float32 returned `-0.0` — reported as touching — for
three poses where float64 puts the hulls 7.2, 16.5 and 16.9 CENTIMETRES apart.
A phantom contact at 17 cm injects a constraint row and a force out of nowhere,
and nothing downstream can tell it from a real one.

⚠ EVERY GJK TEST IN THE TREE RUNS AT FLOAT64, so none of this was visible:
`test_mesh_collision`, `test_gjk_simplex`, `test_epa_optimality_cylinder_mesh`
and the MuJoCo comparisons all use float64, where the criterion behaves. The
engine runs float32 in training and in the viewer.

THE FIX is a scale-relative floor at float32 only — the float64 branch is the
literal old constant, so every float64 gate is bit-identical. See
`GJK_TOLERANCE` in `collision/gjk.mojo`.

⚠ THIS GATES THE PHANTOM CONTACT, NOT AN ERROR BOUND, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
Two poses in this sweep (185 and 187) carry float32 distance errors of 1.9e-3
and 8.2e-2 that are PRESENT BEFORE AND AFTER the fix, unchanged to the digit —
a separate, still-open float32 robustness problem in the distance path. Writing
a tight error bound here would either fail on those two or be so loose it
gates nothing. "Never report contact when the reference says centimetres" is
the property that actually matters and the one the fix delivers.
