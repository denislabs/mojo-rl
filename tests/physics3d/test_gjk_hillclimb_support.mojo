"""The hill-climb support point must EQUAL the linear scan's, on real hulls.

    pixi run mojo run -I . tests/physics3d/test_gjk_hillclimb_support.mojo

⚠ RUN FROM THE REPO ROOT — the fixture meshes are addressed by repo-root
relative path.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `_support_mesh` is the hottest function in mesh collision —
GJK and EPA call it 10-30 times per geom pair per step — and it used to scan
every hull vertex. It now walks the hull's edge graph instead, greedily
stepping to whichever neighbour scores higher on `dir`, RESUMING FROM THE
VERTEX THE PREVIOUS CALL LANDED ON. On a CONVEX hull the dot product has
exactly one local maximum, so the walk is EXACT from any start rather than
approximate, and this file is what holds that claim to account:

                          scan     + climb   + warm start
    SO-ARM101 33 076 v   76.03 ms  12.79 ms    4.74 ms   ( 13 -> 211 Hz)
    SO-ARM100  2 551 v   11.95 ms   5.35 ms    2.82 ms   ( 84 -> 354 Hz)

⚠⚠ A WRONG SUPPORT POINT DOES NOT CRASH. It yields a contact in a plausible
but wrong place, or a slightly shallow penetration, and everything downstream
keeps running. Convergence checks cannot see it either — GJK converges happily
against a support function that is consistently wrong. Only comparing against
the exhaustive answer catches it, which is what this does.

HOW THE TWO PATHS ARE SELECTED WITHOUT A FLAG. `_support_mesh` falls back to
the scan when `mesh_vert_edgeadr[vert_adr] < 0`, which is how `fields/model.
mojo` marks a mesh whose graph was never built. Filling that tensor with -1
therefore exercises the scan on the SAME hull and the SAME directions, with no
test-only branch in the shipping code — a flag would have been a second thing
to keep honest.

⚠ THE FIXTURES ARE REAL SCANNED HULLS, NOT A CUBE. Hill climbing is trivially
correct on a cube and on any tidy convex cloud; where it can go wrong is
near-coplanar facets and long thin geometry, which is what CAD exports are made
of. `test_mesh_support.mojo` already covers the cube.

⚠ THE DIRECTIONS ARE DETERMINISTIC AND COVER THE SPHERE. A handful of axis
directions would miss exactly the wedges where a greedy walk could stall; the
sweep below is a Fibonacci lattice, which spreads without needing an RNG.
