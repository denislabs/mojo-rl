"""Does MAX destroy its stream on its own — with CUDAGraph nowhere in sight?

⚠ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE I ASSERTED SOMETHING I HAD NOT TESTED. I concluded
"MAX 26.5.0rc2 destroys its stream" from traces taken while `CUDAGraph` was
running, which cannot distinguish MAX's own behaviour from something OUR
code provokes — and the reasonable objection is that MAX destroying streams
per-synchronize would be strange, and that graph capture demonstrably worked
before, so the change is more likely ours.

This probe removes every one of our moving parts. It never constructs a
`CUDAGraph`, never dlopens the interceptor, never calls a single
`intercept_*` entry point. It only launches kernels and synchronizes. The
interceptor is present purely because LD_PRELOAD puts it there, and its
`cuStreamDestroy` hook is passive.

    cuStreamDestroy fires between the markers   -> MAX tears its stream down
                                                   on its own. Our Mojo file
                                                   is exonerated; the
                                                   borrowed-stream premise
                                                   really is gone.
    no destroy at all                           -> MAX keeps its stream, and
                                                   the destroys we saw were
                                                   PROVOKED by something
                                                   CUDAGraph does. The bug is
                                                   ours and this arc's
                                                   conclusion is wrong.

⚠ NEEDS MOJO_RL_INTERCEPT_LOG=1. The destroy log is rate-limited to 2 lines
by default (it is on the hot path — MAX's teardown happens often enough that
logging it unconditionally slowed training measurably). The env var lifts the
limit AND is what makes the per-launch stream lines visible.

⚠ `flush=True` ON EVERY PRINT IS LOAD-BEARING. Mojo's stdout is block
buffered while the interceptor writes to unbuffered stderr, so without
flushing, the two streams interleave in the wrong order and the whole
question — WHERE does the destroy fall relative to our markers — becomes
unanswerable. This is the same buffering that made three crash runs of this
arc look like they died earlier than they did.
