"""Minimal gate for `mojo_rl/cuda/device_graph.mojo`: record, replay, latch.

The successor to `test_cuda_graph_minimal.mojo`, and much smaller, because
most of what that file gates does not exist here: there is no interceptor to
be unhooked, no `LD_PRELOAD` to be missing, no borrowed stream to be destroyed
under us, and no silent zero-node capture. `DeviceGraph` is a supported API
that either records or raises.

⚠ **ONE TEST ON ONE `DeviceContext`, DELIBERATELY.** The two-test version of
this file HUNG on a 5090 while `probe_device_graph_steps.mojo` — the same
calls, a plain `main`, no harness — ran clean end to end (`recorded = True`,
counter 1 -> 2 -> 3). The only differences were `TestSuite` and a SECOND
`DeviceContext` constructed after the first had been destroyed. If this file
ever hangs again, run that probe FIRST: it separates "the graph API is broken"
from "the harness is", and last time the answer was the harness.

## The arithmetic is the assertion, and it holds on BOTH platforms

N calls to `maybe_record_replay` must produce EXACTLY N increments, whichever
path ran:

    NVIDIA   call 1 runs STEP once (the warm-up) and RECORDS a second,
             non-executing pass; calls 2..N replay.        1 + (N-1) = N
    Apple    `DeviceGraph.create` raises, the slot latches disabled, and
             STEP runs directly every call.                    N

That equality is the whole contract — the caller's loop must not care which
happened — and it makes a Mac a real correctness check rather than a build
check. It also catches the two failures that would otherwise be silent: a
`build` that EXECUTES lands on N+1, and a replay that runs nothing lands on 1.

⚠ `test_platform_contract` is what stops the arithmetic test passing
vacuously. On Apple every arm of this file can pass with nothing recorded at
all, so the platform contract is pinned separately: NVIDIA must end up
RECORDED, everything else DISABLED. Without it, "N increments" only proves
`STEP` was called N times, which the disabled path does by definition.

Run with:
    pixi run -e nvidia mojo run -I . tests/cuda/test_device_graph_minimal.mojo
    pixi run -e apple  mojo run -I . tests/cuda/test_device_graph_minimal.mojo

    # if it hangs, this is the bisector — 11 numbered, FLUSHED stages, no
    # TestSuite. Mojo's stdout is BLOCK buffered, so a hung run shows you
    # nothing it printed and the last line you saw is not where it stopped.
    pixi run -e nvidia mojo build -I . -o /tmp/probe_dg \
        tests/cuda/probe_device_graph_steps.mojo && /tmp/probe_dg

    # bisect a suspected graph problem against a known-good run:
    MOJO_RL_DEVICE_GRAPH=0 pixi run -e nvidia mojo run -I . \
        tests/cuda/test_device_graph_minimal.mojo

    no harness — ran clean end to end. The only differences were `TestSuite`

    Merging removes both, and costs nothing: the two assertions were always
    about the same run.

    ⚠ AND THEY BELONG TOGETHER ANYWAY. The arithmetic alone is satisfied
    trivially by the disabled path — `STEP` called N times increments N times
    whether or not anything was ever recorded — so a NVIDIA regression that
    silently stopped recording would still pass it. The platform assertion is
    what makes the count mean something, so asserting them on the same slot
    is stronger than asserting them on two.
