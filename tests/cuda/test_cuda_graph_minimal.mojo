"""Minimal CUDA-graph gate: does capture/replay still work AT ALL?

⚠⚠ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE CAPTURE CAN FAIL SILENTLY AND NOTHING WOULD SAY SO.
`CUDAGraph` does not talk to the CUDA driver directly — every call goes
through `mojo_rl/cuda/libcuda_intercept.so`, an LD_PRELOAD shim that hooks
CUDA via `dlsym` and DISCOVERS MOJO'S INTERNAL STREAM by watching which
stream Mojo enqueues on (hence "requires at least one prior kernel launch
for stream discovery" in `CUDAGraph.__init__`).

That contract is with Mojo's INTERNALS, not a public API, and nothing about
it is compile-checked. It breaks if a Mojo upgrade changes stream handling,
or if the runtime moves its driver calls behind `cuGetProcAddress` (which
modern CUDA prefers) where a `dlsym` hook cannot see them. The failure is not
an error: `cuStreamBeginCapture` succeeds on a stream nothing is enqueued to,
`cuStreamEndCapture` returns an EMPTY graph, and replaying it does nothing —
or faults. `maybe_capture_replay`'s own comment predicts exactly this ("a
tiny/zero node count means capture silently failed").

The two existing capture tests (`test_dqn_gpu_batched_capture_smoke`,
`test_dreamerv3_capture_parity`) are agent-level smokes: they take minutes,
they drag in networks and replay buffers, and if they fail you cannot tell
capture from the agent. This file is the primitive underneath them — one
1-element buffer and one increment kernel, seconds to run — so that "is the
graph harness alive?" is answerable on its own.

⚠ ASSERTING `num_nodes() > 0` IS THE POINT. A test that only checks the
replayed VALUE can pass while capturing nothing, because the settle run in
`maybe_capture_replay` executes the work for real. Node count is the only
direct evidence that the graph contains anything.

Platform contract, both halves gated here:
  NVIDIA      real capture; the graph holds nodes; replay executes it.
  non-NVIDIA  every method is a comptime no-op and `maybe_capture_replay`
              runs STEP on EVERY call — bit-identical to not using graphs.
              That is what makes Apple a valid correctness (not performance)
              check, so it is worth pinning rather than assuming.

⚠⚠ IF THIS CRASHES OR ABORTS, SUSPECT A DEAD DeviceContext FIRST.
Mojo destroys a value at its LAST USE, not at end of scope. If a caller
writes `var g = CUDAGraph(ctx)` and never mentions `ctx` again, the context
is destroyed the moment `__init__` returns — and MAX's destructor
SYNCHRONIZES AND DESTROYS the stream being captured. `CUDAGraph` now stores
the context to make that impossible, but the same trap applies to anything
holding a borrowed FFI handle.

That single mechanism produced every symptom of the 2026-08-09 arc, and each
one invited a different wrong theory:

    cuStreamDestroy on our handle           the destructor, not stream pooling
    cuStreamSynchronize "during capture"    the destructor, not MAX bookkeeping
    SIGSEGV in BeginCapture / EndCapture /  use-after-free on a freed stream —
      GetCaptureInfo_v2                     undefined, hence INCONSISTENT
                                            (rc=0 here, a fault there)

⚠ INCONSISTENCY ACROSS ENTRY POINTS IS THE TELL. Several APIs failing several
different ways is far more likely to be ONE dangling handle than several
bugs. Chasing them separately cost eight rounds here.

⚠ `MODULAR_DEBUG=device-sync-mode` CANNOT DEBUG CAPTURE. It synchronizes after
every device op, and a synchronize during capture is illegal — so it
manufactures a CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED of its own.

⚠ `"CUDA call failed: ..."` is MAX's error formatter; ours are tagged
`[CUDAGraph]`. Read the prefix before assuming the fault is in this file.
