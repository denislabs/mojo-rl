"""Where does a `DeviceGraph` step actually hang? A numbered, flushed trace.

    pixi run -e nvidia mojo build -I . -o /tmp/probe_dg \\
        tests/cuda/probe_device_graph_steps.mojo
    /tmp/probe_dg                    # bare: no pixi, so no LD_PRELOAD

⚠ **`flush=True` ON EVERY PRINT IS LOAD-BEARING** — the same note
`probe_max_stream_lifetime.mojo:33` carries. Mojo's stdout is block-buffered,
so a hung process shows you NOTHING it printed, and the last line you see is
not where it stopped. `test_device_graph_minimal.mojo` hung on a 5090 printing
only the interceptor's own (C, line-buffered) banner, which made it look like
the hang was before any Mojo code ran. It was not; the output was simply still
in the buffer. `stdbuf -oL` does not help either — that sets the C runtime's
mode, and Mojo does its own buffering above it.

⚠ **NO `TestSuite` HERE, ON PURPOSE.** A hang inside a test harness cannot be
told apart from a hang in the harness itself, and `discover_tests` instantiates
every top-level def for the host before running anything. A plain `main` with
numbered stages removes both variables.

## Reading it

The trace bisects the whole path, and where it stops names the culprit:

    stops before [1]   not this file — check for a stale process holding the
                       GPU (`nvidia-smi`), which is easy to have after a
                       Ctrl-C'd profile run. An absent shell prompt is not a
                       dead run.
    stops at [1]       DeviceContext creation. Environment, not graphs.
    stops at [3]       a BARE kernel launch + synchronize, no graph anywhere.
                       Also not graphs — JIT/ptxas or a wedged device.
    stops at [6]       `DeviceGraph.create` — recording itself.
    stops at [9]       `replay()`.
    stops at [11]      teardown: releasing the graph, or freeing a buffer the
                       graph still points at.

Stage [3] is the important one. It uses no graph API at all, so if the trace
stops there the problem was never in `device_graph.mojo` and every conclusion
drawn from "the graph test hangs" is about the machine instead.
