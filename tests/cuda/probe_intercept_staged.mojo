"""Staged interceptor probe — which call in `CUDAGraph.__init__` dies?

`test_cuda_graph_minimal` crashes on NVIDIA, so the graph harness is broken
independently of SAC / replay / physics. This walks `CUDAGraph.__init__`'s
interceptor calls ONE AT A TIME, printing before and after each, so a single
run names the failing call instead of leaving us with an unwind whose frames
#3 and #6 are the same libc trampoline.

It does NOT use `CUDAGraph` — it loads the .so directly, so nothing is hidden
behind the wrapper.

⚠ RUN ON A TTY, NOT INTO A FILE. Mojo's `print` is block-buffered when stdout
is a pipe, and a SIGSEGV never flushes it — you would lose exactly the lines
that matter. If you must redirect, expect the tail to be missing.

⚠ THE ARITY HYPOTHESIS WAS TESTED AND REFUTED (NVIDIA, 2026-08-09).
Declaring a 1-argument signature for the zero-argument C function produced
the IDENTICAL crash at the IDENTICAL address, so `_DLCallable.__call__` is
not secretly invoking the function. The stage below measures the resolved
pointer rather than reasoning about it.

⚠ AND THE ADDRESS MATCH MAY BE A COINCIDENCE. Frames #3 and #6 of that stack
are the same libc trampoline, so the unwind is unreliable past #5; `#7` could
be a stack word that merely HOLDS the stream rather than the faulting PC. The
`fn-value bits` print below is what settles it — it needs no unwinder.

SUPERSEDED HYPOTHESIS, kept because it shaped the probe: `graph.mojo` unwraps every symbol with a trailing
`()`, per its own note that `_DLCallable.__call__` is variadic and discards
arguments. That works for symbols WITH arguments, where unwrap and call are
distinguishable. `intercept_get_mojo_stream` is the only ZERO-ARGUMENT one:

    var get_stream = lib.get_function[def() thin -> _CUptr](name)()
    self._mojo_stream = get_stream()

For a 0-arg signature both spellings are `()`, so if the first one CALLS
rather than unwraps, `get_stream` holds the STREAM VALUE typed as a function
pointer and the second `()` jumps to it. The reported `#7` equalled the
stream address the interceptor printed, which is what that would look like.

READ THE OUTPUT LIKE THIS:
  crash before "get_stream unwrapped"   -> dlopen/dlsym, not the ABI
  crash between unwrap and "stream ="   -> the 0-arg ambiguity above; the
                                           `_ARG` variant below is the fix
  "stream = 0x..." matches the value the
  interceptor printed                   -> unwrap is fine, look further down
  crash at stream_create / begin_capture-> the ambiguity is NOT the bug;
                                           suspect the interceptor vs the
                                           current Mojo runtime (stream
                                           discovery, cuGetProcAddress)

    # ── 1. WHAT DID THE UNWRAP ACTUALLY PRODUCE? ─────────────────────────
    #
    # The arity hypothesis is DEAD: declaring a 1-arg signature for the 0-arg
    # C function changed nothing (same crash, same address), so
    # `_DLCallable.__call__` is not silently invoking the function.
    #
    # So measure the pointer instead of reasoning about it. A `thin` function
    # value is one word, so reading the variable's own bytes as an Int gives
    # the address the call will jump to. Three outcomes, all decisive:
    #
    #   bits == the stream address the interceptor printed
    #        -> the unwrap really is handing back the stream. Wrong VALUE.
    #   bits inside libcuda_intercept.so's mapped range (see /proc/self/maps)
    #        -> the pointer is CORRECT and the CALL is what faults: an ABI or
    #           calling-convention problem with `thin`, not a lookup problem.
    #   bits == 0
    #        -> dlsym never resolved the symbol; check the .so's exports.
    #
    # `begin_capture` is the control: a symbol resolved the same way that is
    # known to have worked. If its bits look like code and `get_stream`'s do
    # not, the difference is the symbol, not the machinery.
