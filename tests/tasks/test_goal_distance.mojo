"""THE SHAPED TERM'S DISTANCE — zero exactly when the goal holds.

    pixi run mojo run -I . tests/tasks/test_goal_distance.mojo

## ⚠⚠ WHY A DISTANCE EXISTS

`so101_gather_bricks` paid +1 on success and nothing otherwise. Measured on a
5090: 125k env-steps, ~384 episodes, a rate indistinguishable from random. At
~1.5% success that is about SIX rewarding transitions in 125,000 — 5e-05 of
the replay buffer, which a batch of 256 contains 1.4% of the time. The critic
almost never saw a success. `gpu_eval.tape_distance_gpu` is the quantity a
shaped term needs, derived from the TAPE so it covers the whole goal language
rather than one task.

## WHAT THIS ASSERTS

1. **ZERO IFF THE GOAL HOLDS**, over a sweep of states and every shipped task.
   Two separate switches walk one tape — `eval_tape_gpu` returns a Bool and
   this returns a metre — so an op the distance forgot shows up as a
   disagreement rather than as a term with no gradient. A forgotten op is the
   likely failure and it is SILENT: the reward keeps working, the shaping just
   quietly does nothing for that predicate.

2. **THE 0.5 BOUND**, which three files depend on without saying so.
   `task_batched_gpu.mojo`, `task_eval_frozen.mojo` and this family's own
   success counting all read "solved" as `reward > 0.5`, and shaping is
   SUBTRACTED from that same scalar. If the penalty could reach 0.5 a solved
   lane would report 0.4 and every success counter in the tree would read it
   as a miss — with no error anywhere.

3. **MONOTONE TOWARD THE GOAL** — moving a prop closer must not increase the
   distance. A sign error passes checks 1 and 2 perfectly and trains the
   policy to run away.
