Three envs walk the same driven rollout. The float64 CPU env is the
trajectory; before EVERY control step its `qpos`/`qvel` are injected into
the GPU lanes and into a float32 CPU env, all three take one step, and the
64-D observations are compared. Three columns come out:

    GPU   vs CPU64   — what a trainer on the device sees against the gate
                       the G1 was proved on (`test_unitree_g1_vs_mujoco`)
    CPU32 vs CPU64   — the PRECISION floor: same code, same device, the
                       dtype alone
    GPU   vs CPU32   — the DEVICE column: same dtype, same algorithm; this
                       is the one that is gated

⚠⚠ WHY NOT A FREE-RUNNING LOCKSTEP LIKE `test_humanoid_gpu_vs_cpu`. The
first run of this file on the 5090 (2026-09-09) did that: both lanes
identical to every digit, the first ten steps inside 1e-4 + 1e-3|cpu|,
then 522 elements out of band from step 11, peaking at 0.07 on a joint
velocity of ~5 and falling back to 1e-4 before rising again at step 52.
That shape is the reference's own behaviour under any perturbation:
MuJoCo perturbed by 1e-11 in one joint is 1e-3 from itself at step 99 on
this rollout, non-monotone in the perturbation size. A free-running
comparison of a float32 solve against a float64 one on a contact-rich
35-dof body measures the Lyapunov exponent, not the device. Re-injecting
the state every step is what made the MuJoCo gate decidable
(`docs/menagerie_fidelity_harnesses/g1/inject.py`), and it is what makes
this one decidable.

WHAT THIS GATES THAT THE HUMANOID GATE DOES NOT: `custom_apply_actions_gpu`
(the torque PD per lane per substep, with the effort clip THEN the motor
ctrlrange clamp read from the actuator records), the observation layout on
the device, and mesh-vs-plane / mesh-vs-mesh multicontact on the batched
path at nv 35 with 40 collidable meshes.

⚠⚠ NVIDIA-ONLY. nv 35 is above the nv 24 at which the SO-101 family
exhausted Metal's per-thread stack in the Newton solver; on Apple this
SKIPS with a message. Until it has run green on the 5090 the G1's GPU
hooks are compiled but NOT VALUE-GATED.

⚠⚠ A FLOAT32 STEP CAN SIT ON A KNIFE-EDGE, AND THEN THE SAME-DTYPE TWIN
IS NOT A REFERENCE EITHER. Second run on the 5090 (2026-09-09, this
protocol): 58 of 60 steps agree across all three columns to 1e-5 (1e-4 at
step 1), lanes exact. Step 44: the float32 CPU env is 0.73 off float64 on
a joint velocity FROM THE SAME INJECTED STATE while the GPU is 1e-5 from
float64 — a contact decision that float32 rounding flipped on the host
and not on the device. Step 11: the mirror, GPU 0.0675 off float64 and
the float32 CPU with it. Neither is a device defect; both are the
reference's contact discontinuities resolved by the last bit of a
float32 solve. So the rule is:

    a device step PASSES if it reproduces the float64 answer OR the
    same-dtype CPU answer within `ATOL + RTOL * |cpu64|`;
    the float64 agreement must hold on at least `MIN_F64_FRACTION` of
    the steps, so the escape cannot carry a broken device path;
    every step where float32 and float64 part by more than the band is
    printed as a KNIFE-EDGE and counted — that count (2 of 60 here) is
    the number a trainer on the device should know.

The band is measured, not inherited: 10x the 1e-4 the normal steps show.
A TF32 path would show up as every step wide, not two
(`_a_gpu_vs_cpu_band_written_on_metal_is_a_tf32_trap_on_cuda`).
