⚠⚠ CORRECTED 2026-09-14: IT BUILDS AND STEPS ON APPLE TOO. The failure below
was not the nv = 37 stack: it was eight `ScratchPool`-backed scratches in the
elliptic Newton kernel (`cap[]` is 0 for a model with no tendons/equalities),
the same defect NVIDIA's ptxas reported as an unresolved
`KGEN_CompilerRT_GetOrCreateGlobal`. The paragraph is kept for the record.

(Historical:) RUN THIS ON NVIDIA, AND ON APPLE IT DOES NOT FAIL AT RUNTIME — IT
FAILS TO BUILD. `libero_goal` is nv = 37 and the Newton solver's per-thread arrays are
sized by it; Metal's backend answers "Metal Compiler failed to compile
metallib" and no binary is produced. That is not a bug to catch: the P0 park
probe died the same way at nv = 24, and `examples/tasks/task_eval_frozen.mojo`
carries the same warning for the SO-101 family.

⚠ WHICH MAKES THIS FILE THE TYPE CHECK ON A LAPTOP. Elaboration runs to
completion before Metal codegen, so a build that reaches the metallib error has
type-checked every comptime branch the controller adds — the layouts
`osc_control_step` binds, the `DynamicsScratch` in its `List`, the
`apply_actions_kernel_gpu` call fed from `ctrl` instead of `actions`, and the
`ACTION_DIM == 7` assert. `tests/tasks/test_libero_osc_env.mojo` keeps the
NVIDIA leg behind `comptime if has_nvidia_gpu_accelerator()` so the suite still
runs on Apple; this one does not, deliberately.

## WHAT IT PRINTS, AND WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT SHOW

Per control step: the mean and max end-effector speed, the arm's mean |torque|,
and how many lanes reported a SINGULAR operational-space inertia. With a zero
action the arm should hold — so the speeds say whether the controller is
actually closing its loop through the integrator, which is the one thing no
CPU-side gate can show.

⚠ THE NUMBERS ARE NOT A FIDELITY CLAIM. What the controller computes is gated
by `tests/tasks/test_osc_control_batched.mojo` (eight lanes against `OscPose`,
1.7e-14 of the torque scale) and `tools/tasks/libero_demo_replay.py` (one lane
against MuJoCo, 1.5e-5 m over a recorded demo). This shows the WIRING carries
those numbers into the physics; a lane-by-lane comparison against the CPU loop
in `examples/tasks/libero_eval.mojo` is the gate that closes it, and it is owed
on the box.

⚠ THE REWARD IS ZERO UNTIL A TAPE IS WRITTEN. `LiberoGoalOscConfig`'s reward
IS the goal tape (`eval_tape_gpu` over `meta`), and this driver writes no tape —
so `_reward` is 0 by construction here, exactly as the config's docstring says.
Placing the free slots and writing the tape per lane is the task layer's, and
`tasks/gpu_eval.mojo` is where it lives.
