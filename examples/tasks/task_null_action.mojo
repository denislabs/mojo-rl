"""IS THE GOAL SOLVED BY A CONSTANT ACTION? — CPU, and it is a GATE.

## ⚠⚠ THE DEGENERACY `test_task_reset_steps` CANNOT SEE

That gate asserts every shipped task's goal is FALSE AT RESET, and every one
of them passes. `so101_reach_brick` passed it — 0 of 8 lanes — and an
UNTRAINED greedy SAC actor then met it on 64 of 64 episodes. "Solved at reset"
and "solved by a constant action" are DIFFERENT degeneracies: the first is
evaluated before any step, the second after the policy's default output has
been applied for a while.

⚠ AND A CONSTANT ACTION IS NOT AN ODD CASE, IT IS WHAT AN UNTRAINED POLICY
EMITS. `tanh(mu)` for a freshly initialised actor is a near-constant vector,
so whatever a constant action achieves is the floor every training curve
starts from — and a task whose floor is 1.0 has nothing above it.

## ⚠⚠ WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHY THE PER-STEP TRACE IS THE POINT

A goal met on ONE step of a 300-step episode and a goal met on the LAST 200
are the same "success" to a reward that fires per step and an episode that
terminates on the first hit. They are not the same task:

    passed THROUGH     the arm swept the gripper across the region on its way
                       somewhere else. Any large joint motion does this, and
                       no policy had to aim.
    arrived and HELD   the commanded pose is inside the region.

So this prints the first hit, the total hits and the LONGEST RUN of
consecutive hits. A long run at the end of the episode is "arrived"; a short
run in the middle is "swept through", and a task that a sweep satisfies is not
a reaching task — it is a moving test.

⚠ CPU AND SINGLE-ENV ON PURPOSE. The question is about one deterministic
rollout, `Phyics3dEnv` gives exactly that, and it runs in the normal suite
where a GPU example cannot.
