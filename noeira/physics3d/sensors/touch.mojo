"""Touch sensor — MuJoCo `<touch site="..."/>`.

Port of `engine_sensor.c`'s `mjSENS_TOUCH` case. The sensor sums the NORMAL
force of every active contact that (a) involves the site's body and (b) whose
contact point projects into the site's volume along the contact normal:

    for each contact j with efc_address >= 0:
        if site_body not in {body(geom0), body(geom1)}: skip
        f = mj_contactForce(j)[0]           # normal component, contact frame
        if f <= 0: skip
        ray = normalize(frame_normal * f)   # == the unit normal, geom1 -> geom2
        if site_body == body(geom2): ray = -ray
        if rayGeom(site_xpos, site_xmat, site_size, contact_pos, ray, type) >= 0:
            sensordata += f

⚠ OUR CONTACT NORMAL POINTS `body_b` -> `body_a`, the reverse of MuJoCo's
geom1 -> geom2, so MuJoCo's `geom2` is our `body_a` and the flip above is keyed
on `body_a`. See the comment at the flip itself for the measurement.

Note the ray starts at the CONTACT POINT and is cast along the normal, and the
zone being intersected is the SITE. A contact inside the site volume always
registers; one outside registers only if the normal points through the site.

Used by dm_control's hopper, whose OBSERVATION carries
`np.log1p(sensordata[['touch_toe', 'touch_heel']])` — so this feeds the policy
input, not only a reward term.

SCOPE: sphere and BOX zones, plus ellipsoid zones MEASURED AS a sphere of
radius size[0]. Hopper's sites are spheres; finger's `touchtop`/`touchbottom`
are ellipsoids (`size=".025 .03 .025"`) and take the approximation, which is
exact there because the in-plane semi-axes are equal and the model is planar —
`test_finger_vs_dm_control::test_touch_site_sphere_approximation_is_exact`
pins both facts. Any OTHER site type raises rather than being silently
treated as a sphere; a capsule zone needs its own ray test.

Box zones landed 2026-08-01 with manipulator, all five of whose `<touch>`
sensors are boxes. They are the first zone whose answer depends on the site's
ORIENTATION, which is why they had to wait for the site quaternion to reach
the model record (`SITE_IDX_QUAT_*`). Two of manipulator's zones carry
`euler="0 15 0"`, so treating them as axis-aligned is not a small error on the
two pads that decide whether a grasp registers.

PRECONDITION: contact records must be POST-SOLVE, i.e. read after the
integrator has run the constraint solve for this step. `CONTACT_IDX_FORCE_N`
is zero before that, so a hook that reads it too early gets a silent all-zero
sensor rather than an error.

    longer reachable from a site type; it is kept only so a caller that still
    tests for it keeps compiling.

    ⚠ THE BOX BRANCH LANDED BECAUSE dog NEEDED IT, not manipulator/stacker.
    This function used to reject box zones with a note saying tranche 4 would
    bring them; dog's four touch sites (palm_L/R, sole_L/R) are `type="box"`,
    so the batched dog reward and the four touch obs dims came back as a

    obs[181], cpu 0.0 vs gpu -1.0. A sentinel rather than a plausible number
    is what made that a one-line diagnosis.

    ELLIPSOID is now a REAL ellipsoid, as on the CPU side — the shared
    `ray_geom` has no sphere approximation in it. The two paths therefore
    still agree, which is what `test_dog_gpu_vs_cpu` checks.

    ⚠⚠ THE RAY FLIP IS ON `body_a`, NOT `body_b`. MuJoCo flips when the
    sensorized body carries `geom2`; our normal points BODY_B -> BODY_A, so
    MuJoCo's geom2 is our `body_a`. Flipping on the wrong one reverses every
    ray and only changes the ANSWER for contacts OUTSIDE the zone — which is
    why it survived four domains on the CPU side before stacker caught it.
