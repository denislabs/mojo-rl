# | noeira serial — a raw-mode tty over libc
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
"""`SerialPort`: open a tty, put it in 8N1 raw mode at an arbitrary baud, and
read/write bytes against a deadline.

Deliberately knows nothing about servos. The Feetech packet layer sits on top
in `noeira/robot/feetech/`, and the same fd plumbing is what a native socket
sink would reuse (`docs/RERUN_ASSESSMENT.md` §5.5).

Two facts that cost an afternoon each, both measured 2026-08-25 on Darwin
25.5 / arm64 against a real SO-101 bus:

* **Use `/dev/cu.*`, not `/dev/tty.*`.** The `tty.` callin device blocks in
  `open` waiting for carrier detect. `cu.` is the callout device and does not.
  (pyserial hides this by always passing `O_NONBLOCK`; so do we, but the
  device choice still matters for anything that later clears the flag.)
* **`tcsetattr` REJECTS a literal 1 000 000 with EINVAL** on macOS, even
  though BSD's `Bxxx` constants *are* the baud numbers (`B230400 == 230400`).
  Only `IOSSIOSPEED` gets there — see `native.mojo` for why that needs C.
