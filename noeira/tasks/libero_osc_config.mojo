"""Every LIBERO family on the batched GPU env, driven by OSC_POSE — ONE config.

    from noeira.tasks.libero_scenes.libero_kitchen_scene3_xml import (
        LiberoKitchenScene3OscEnv,
    )
    var env = LiberoKitchenScene3OscEnv[N](ctx, seed)
    env.set_osc_refs(build_osc_refs(...), ctx)     # from the parsed scene
    env.reset_batch[N](ctx, seed)
    env.step_batch[N](ctx, seed)

## ⚠⚠ ONE CONFIG, PARAMETERISED ON THE FAMILY'S PLACEMENT TABLE

`LiberoOscConfig[P]` is what `LiberoGoalOscConfig` was, with its table as a
parameter. Every hook it carries is a call into code every family shares, over
`P`:

    init_qpos_gpu            placement/table.reset_task_slots (jinit=, placements)
    pre_step_full_gpu        task_hooks.repark_inactive_slots
    custom_extract_obs_*     task_hooks.write_task_obs(_host)
    compute_reward_and_done  gpu_eval.eval_tape_gpu -> reward AND GOAL_HELD

and nothing else in it differs between the 23 LIBERO families: all of them run
robosuite's Panda under OSC_POSE at `control_freq=20` on a 2 ms timestep, for a
600-step horizon, under Euler. A per-family copy of this file would be 23 copies
of one rule, and `_a_rule_written_inline_twice_drifts` is this tree's most
frequent defect. What IS per family is the model def and its contact budget —
`libero_scenes/<family>_xml.mojo` (generated) and the three hand-written
`libero_{goal,object,spatial}_xml.mojo`.

⚠ THE THREE CONSTANTS BELOW ARE RESTATED FROM EVERY `.family` AND EVERY
GENERATED DIMS FILE, NOT READ — a config is a comptime type, a `.family` is a
runtime file. `tests/tasks/test_libero_task_hooks.mojo` reads all 23 families
and their dims and fails if one disagrees, so a family that ever runs at another
`control_freq` is refused by a gate rather than silently stepped at 20 Hz.

What is per LANE is data in `meta`, written by the driver per episode: the tape
(`tape.encode_goal`), the mask (`active.active_mask`), the init words
(`active.init_region_words`), the joint words (`placement/check.
joint_init_words`); and, once, the region table in `curriculum`
(`gpu_eval.region_table_words`).

## ⚠ FRAME_SKIP IS 25 AND IT IS NOT A TUNING KNOB

`control_freq=20` and a 2 ms timestep make one policy step 1/20 / 0.002 = 25
substeps — robosuite's own arithmetic (`MujocoEnv.__init__`:
`self.control_timestep = 1. / control_freq`). The controller's `set_goal` fires
on substep 0 of those 25 and the torque law runs on all of them;
`dynamics/osc_control.mojo` says why that gate matters.

## ⚠ `NORMALIZED_ACTIONS` IS FALSE, AND THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE SO-101

There the action is [-1, 1] per joint mapped onto each actuator's `ctrlrange`,
because the policy commands joint POSITIONS. Here it commands end-effector
DELTAS in metres and radians, which `osc_set_goal_gpu` scales by
`output_max_pos` / `output_max_ori` itself (0.05 m, 0.5 rad — robosuite's
`osc_pose.json`). Normalising on top of that would scale the deltas twice.
