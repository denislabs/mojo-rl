"""Reading the active mask INSIDE a kernel, and what it does to the obs. P3d.

`active.active_mask` is the HOST half — it takes a `TaskSpec` and a
`FamilySpec` and produces one float. This is the DEVICE half: it takes that
float and knows nothing about either.

The split is the same one `tape.mojo` / `gpu_eval.mojo` already make in this
package, and for the same two reasons. A kernel cannot hold a `TaskSpec`; and
keeping the spec parser out of the observation hook's compile unit keeps the
family config's instantiation small.

## ⚠⚠ NO `Float64` BELOW

Metal has no double. Everything is `Scalar[DTYPE]` or `Int`.

## WHAT AN INACTIVE SLOT LOOKS LIKE IN THE OBSERVATION

Zeros in its pose words, and a 0 in its own mask word.

⚠ THE ZERO IS NOT THE POINT — THE MASK WORD IS. Zeroing alone would be the
same convention the mask exists to remove, one constant swapped for another.
What makes it safe is that the constant is now ANNOUNCED: the policy is handed
"this slot is absent" as a value, and the pose words beside it are zeroed only
so that the parked pose — which is 50 m up, lateral, and FALLING, because
nothing reparks it — does not swamp the observation's scale.

⚠ AND THAT IS WHY THE ZEROING CANNOT BE DROPPED "because the mask says so".
An unnormalised +50 in an observation is not neutralised by a 0 elsewhere in
the vector; it dominates the first layer's activations whatever the mask bit
says. The two together are the fix, not either one.
