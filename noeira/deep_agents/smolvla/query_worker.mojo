# | The SmolVLA query, on a thread that is allowed to block
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
"""`SmolVLAQueryWorker` — one observation in, one action chunk out, off the
control thread.

⚠⚠ WHY A THREAD, WHEN THE QUERY IS ALL ENQUEUES. `SmolVLAPolicy.start_action`
submits the whole query without synchronising, and that was supposed to be
enough: submit, keep commanding the arm, collect later. MEASURED ON AN ORIN IT
IS NOT. A query is ~6970 kernel launches; once the driver's pending-launch
queue fills, `cuLaunchKernel` stops being asynchronous and blocks until slots
free. Submission cost **619.5 ms of a 663.7 ms query** — 93% — so the control
loop was stuck inside the submission and the arm froze anyway.

A thread is the fix that does not depend on driver queue depth: this worker is
ALLOWED to block. The control loop keeps the serial bus and the 30 Hz grid; the
worker keeps the GPU.

## The split, and why it falls this way

    control thread          worker thread
    --------------          -------------
    serial bus              DeviceContext + the 3.2 GB policy
    the 30 Hz grid          the query
    cameras + resize        —
    clamps and writes       —

The cameras stay with the control loop on purpose: their reader is a
single-consumer ring, and moving the consumer would leave the loop unable to
tell a stale frame from a fresh one. The cost is the observation build (~68 ms,
two grid steps) still landing on the control thread — small against the 620 ms
this removes, and the ACT loop's answer (resize on the camera thread) closes it
later without touching any of this.

## The protocol

One request ring (images + pose), one response ring (the chunk in robot
units), and cells for state and timings. Exactly one producer and one consumer
per ring, which is what `SpscRing` requires:

    control -> `req`: [pose: RDIM float32][images: N_CAM*3*IMG*IMG float32]
    worker  -> `rsp`: [chunk: CHUNK*RDIM float32]

⚠ THE WORKER OWNS ITS OWN `images`/`noise` TENSORS. The request's bytes are
copied into them before the query starts, so the control thread may refill its
own tensor the moment `end_push` returns — the two never share a buffer.

⚠ NOTHING HERE MAY RAISE (`BackgroundWorker`'s contract — pthread has no
exception channel). Every failure is caught, printed, and latched into
`QW_STATE`, which the control thread must check before arming anything.
