# | SmolVLA — attention with a static [Q_LEN, KV_LEN] block mask
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
"""The one attention shape the denoising step needs and no existing leaf has.

    q [B, Q_LEN*DIM]   k,v [B, KV_LEN*DIM]   mask [Q_LEN, KV_LEN] additive
    out[b,i] = concat_h( softmax_j( q·kᵀ/sqrt(HEAD_DIM) + mask[i,j] ) · v )

`nn` already ships three attention leaves and none fits:

  * `ScaledDotProductAttention` — packed `[Q|K|V]` of ONE sequence.
  * `MaskedAttention` — has the static 2-D mask, but packed and `Q_LEN == KV_LEN`.
    Using it would mean recomputing the prefix's queries, which is what the KV
    cache exists to avoid.
  * `CrossAttention` — separate q/k/v and `Q_LEN != KV_LEN`, but its mask is a
    per-sample KEY PADDING mask `[B, KV_LEN]`. A key is masked for every query or
    for none, so it cannot express causality.

The denoising step needs `Q_LEN != KV_LEN` **and** a query-dependent mask: the 50
action queries attend to the whole cached prefix but only causally among
themselves.

⚠ **Only the SELF (even) layers need this.** A cross (odd) layer's suffix
attends to the entire prefix with nothing masked, so it can use `CrossAttention`
unmasked. Reaching for a mask there would be harmless and pointless; reaching
for `CrossAttention` in the even case would be silently wrong.

## The backward

`vjp` produces dQ, dK and dV. The leaf is still not a `Module` — `Module`'s
`vjp` takes one packed `TensorRefs` whose members share a dimension, and here
q is `[Q_LEN, DIM]` while k and v are `[KV_LEN, DIM]`. It stays hand-driven,
like `DecoderLayerWeights`.

⚠ **It RECOMPUTES the softmax rather than caching them in the forward**, which
is the opposite of `MaskedAttention` and deliberate. One `SmolVLADenoise`
instance drives all 16 layers through ONE leaf instance, so a forward-time
cache would be overwritten fifteen times before any backward read it — the
leaf would silently return the last layer's gradient for every layer. Being
stateless across the forward/backward boundary is what makes one instance
reusable, and it is also flash-attention's own trade: the probability matrix
never has to exist for the whole forward.

The three gradient kernels cannot all be written from one thread map — dQ
reduces over j, dK and dV reduce over i — so `vjp` materialises the
probabilities into leaf scratch first and then runs three race-free passes:

    probs   one thread per (b, h, i)      writes p[b,h,i,j]
    dV      one block  per (b, h)         dv[j] = Σ_i p[i,j]·g[i]
    dscore  one block  per (b, h)         OVERWRITES p with ds, then dQ
    dK      one block  per (b, h)         dk[j] = Σ_i ds[i,j]·q[i]

⚠ **Those four are order-dependent** — dV reads p, the third pass destroys it.
They are enqueued on one stream, which orders them; splitting them across
streams would not.

⚠ **The mask is applied exactly once**, in the probability pass: a masked (i,j)
gets p = 0, so its ds is 0 and it contributes nothing to dK or dV without any
kernel downstream re-reading the mask. A fully-masked row keeps the forward's
floored denominator, so it yields a zero gradient rather than a NaN.

⚠ **dQ, dK and dV are OVERWRITTEN, not accumulated.** Each is written exactly
once by exactly one pass, so no caller has to zero them first. A driver that
needs to sum gradients from two paths must add them itself.

⚠ A fully-masked query row would divide by zero. Rows are renormalised by a
floored denominator and produce a zero context vector instead of NaN — the same
guard, and the same constant, as `cross_attention.mojo`.

# = 138 750 floats, 555 KB — so materialising them costs nothing, and it lets
# each kernel be indexed by the element it WRITES: adjacent lanes then touch

# recorded as slow (`_row_per_thread_kernels_are_uncoalesced_and_tiny_grid`).
#
# ⚠ NOT BIT-IDENTICAL to the old kernel — the context is now a sum of
# normalised weights rather than a normalised sum. Held to ~2.5e-6 std units of
# a float64 reference on the board, and to `test_block_attention.mojo`'s
# GPU-vs-CPU band, which also exercises B = 2 (the benchmark is B = 1).
#
# ⚠⚠ SECOND PASS (20 Sep 2026): element-indexed was necessary, not sufficient.
# `benchmarks/smolvla_denoise_stages_bench.mojo` on the Orin put these three
# kernels at 16.8 ms of a 27.8 ms denoising step — 1.05 ms per layer for 18 M
# MACs, 1.2% of the board's fp32 peak — while the expert's linears ran at 38%.
# The scores kernel's lanes were adjacent in j, so each lane read its OWN key
# row at a stride of DIM floats: 32 cache lines per warp per head-dim step,
# 64 steps, 4 336 warps — the K reads alone were ~280 MB of L2 sector traffic
# for a 710 KB matrix. And the softmax was one THREAD per row: 750 threads on
# the whole board, three serial passes of 185 loads each, at stride KL.
#
# Now K is packed once per call into `kt[b, h, d, j]` (contiguous in j, the
# same trick as `cross_attention.mojo` §2.1 "Kt contiguous"), so the scores
# kernel's warp reads 128 B per step instead of 32 lines; and the two row
# kernels (the softmax here, `_ba_dscore_kernel` in the backward) are one WARP
# per row — lanes stride the row by 32, coalesced, and the reductions are
# warp reductions. The context kernel was already coalesced (lanes adjacent
# in d) and is unchanged.
#
# ⚠ The row reductions are now warp-tree sums, not serial ones: the
# probabilities and dS move at the last bit. `test_block_attention.mojo`
# (1e-5 vs the torch-gated CPU path) and `test_block_attention_vjp.mojo`
# (central differences) are the bands; the old serial kernels are not a

# ⚠⚠ SIX ELEMENT-INDEXED KERNELS, FOR THE SAME REASON THE FORWARD IS THREE.
# The first backward shipped as four kernels launched ONE BLOCK PER (b, h) with
# the threads striding over rows: at this model's shapes that is 15 blocks and
# 50 live threads each, every thread walking ~36 k serial MACs through
# uncoalesced reads. `SMOLVLA_PROFILE` on a 5090 put it at 33.6 ms of a
# 48.8 ms expert backward — 2.1 ms per layer for 15 x 50 x 190 x 64 MACs,
# about 0.1 % of the card. The shape this repo already recorded as slow
# (`_row_per_thread_kernels_are_uncoalesced_and_tiny_grid`), twice over.
#
# Now every kernel is indexed by the element it WRITES, over the whole grid:
#
#     probs   = softmax(scale q.k + mask)      the forward's own two kernels
#     dP      = g . vᵀ                          one thread per (b,h,i,j)
