⚠ THE PLAN IS DECIDED BEFORE ANYTHING MOVES, AND `.sync.kv` IS WRITTEN AFTER,
EVEN IF A TRANSFER FAILED HALFWAY. A file that did go through is synced, and
recording it means the next run does not re-plan it as a conflict against
its own upload.

⚠ NOTHING HERE DECIDES WHO WINS. That is `push_action` / `pull_action`, pure
and gated by value; this file only carries their answers out.
