## Why this exists

`docs/MODULAR_SOURCE_DEEP_DIVE.md` found that MAX 26.5 SHIPS the API our
`mojo_rl/cuda/graph.mojo` reimplements by hand:

    from max.gpu.host import DeviceGraph, DeviceGraphBuilder

1616 lines in `max.mojoc`, exported from `max/gpu/host/__init__.mojo`, with
MAX's own test at
`references/modular-max-v26.5/max/kernels/test/gpu/device_context/test_device_graph_builder.mojo`
(this file's syntax is copied from it, deliberately).

What we have instead is ~400 lines of `LD_PRELOAD` interceptor that discovers
MAX's INTERNAL stream by watching `cuLaunchKernelEx` and then calls
`cuStreamBeginCapture` on a stream we do not own. That file's own comments are
the bill for it: `cuStreamDestroy` on our handle, driver SIGSEGVs in
BeginCapture / EndCapture / GetCaptureInfo, a load-bearing `_ctx` field, and a
failure mode where capture "succeeds" with ZERO nodes and nothing says so. Plus
[[_the_preload_is_a_property_of_the_process_not_the_binary]]: a binary you
BUILD and then run directly silently loses capture entirely.

`DeviceGraph` is a different mechanism — explicit DAG construction, not stream
capture — so none of that applies. It is a supported API, it needs no preload,
and `recording_context()` claims that ordinary `DeviceContext` code records
unmodified, which would mean our existing `STEP()` closures port as-is.

⚠ THAT IS A DOCSTRING, NOT A MEASUREMENT. This file is the measurement.

## The arms, in order, each independently reportable

  0. is it even here?      imports resolve, `DeviceContext` alive, device named.
  A. add_function          the explicit-DAG path: one node, build must NOT
                           execute, replay must execute exactly once.
  B. recording_context     OUR kernel style (LayoutTensor args) through the
                           ordinary `enqueue_function` API, four launches, order
                           preserved. If this passes, a `STEP()` closure that
                           takes a `DeviceContext` records with NO shim.
  C. a MAX library GEMM    `max_matmul` recorded through `recording_context()`.
                           This is the arm that decides whether our real
                           training steps port, because they are mostly library
                           GEMMs, not hand kernels.
  D. a SPLIT-K GEMM        the known blocker. Predicted to FAIL, and to fail
                           SILENTLY — see below.
  E. timing                eager enqueue vs `graph.replay()`, us/iter.

## What arm D is really testing, and why it is last

Stream capture cannot contain a split-K GEMM at all: MAX's allocator refuses to
serve `enqueue_create_buffer` while a graph is capturing and ABORTS the process
(`benchmarks/bench_cuda_graph_splitk_capture.mojo`;
[[_split_k_cannot_be_cuda_graph_captured]]). `DeviceGraph` has a documented
capture-scoped pool for exactly this — `builder.create_buffer`, "all allocations
created for a device graph should go through this method". But `multistage_gemm`
calls `ctx.enqueue_create_buffer`, and `recording_context()`'s docstring says
buffer allocation FORWARDS TO THE BACKING CONTEXT.

So the predicted failure is worse than an abort: the workspace is allocated
EAGERLY at record time, `multistage_gemm` frees it at `_ = work_space_data^`
when the call returns, and the recorded node keeps the raw pointer. That is a
dangling device pointer on replay — **a wrong answer, not a crash**, and quite
possibly a RIGHT answer on the first replay while the freed block is still
untouched in the pool.

Hence arm D replays TWICE with an allocator CHURN in between, and checks an
analytic checksum both times. A pass on replay 1 and a fail on replay 2 is the
signature of the dangling workspace and is the most likely outcome.

⚠ It may also fault or abort. It runs LAST so that A–C have already printed,
and `MOJO_RL_SPIKE_SPLITK=0` skips it.

⚠ AND IT MUST PROVE IT IS SPLIT-K ON *THIS* CARD. `[256 x 2592] @ [2592 x 256]`
partitions K on a 5090; `select_config` hardcodes `A100.sm_count = 108` in its
wave estimate, so another part can decide otherwise and the arm would be
measuring nothing. It prints `num_k_partitions` and says so when it is 1.
([[_a_capture_abort_names_only_the_first_blocker]]: a size is not an identity.)

## ANSWERED, RTX 5090, MAX 26.5.0 — A, B, C, E PASS; **D FAILS**

    A. add_function        build->0.0   replay1->7.0    replay2(after wipe)->7.0
    B. recording_context   build->0.0   replay1->12.0   replay2(from 99)->12.0
    C. max_matmul          build->0.0   replay1->0.40914977        want 0.4096
    D. SPLIT-K (P=2)       pool reissues a freed 512KB block: YES
                           replay1->4.14263630  replay2(freed churn)->4.14263630
                           replay3(LIVE poison)->4.14263630   want 4.14720
                           **live buffers written through: 1/16**   <-- FAIL
    E. 32 launches         eager 100.62 -> replay 28.57 us/iter = 3.52x
                           (3.14 -> 0.89 us/launch)
                           counter->13440.0 = 13440.0, so they really ran

**A and B settle the migration.** DeviceGraph records both MAX's kernel style
and OURS, with no interceptor, and `build` executes nothing — so a `STEP()`
closure ports by taking a `DeviceContext` ARGUMENT instead of capturing one.
That is the entire change `mojo_rl/cuda/graph.mojo` needs to become deletable,
and it is independent of everything below.

## D: the prediction was right, and the failure is WORSE than an abort

The dispatch question is settled — `-D LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO` prints
`K partitions:` **1, 1, 2, 2**: exactly four lines for the program's four
`matmul` calls (arm C warm + recorded, arm D warm + recorded), in order, and
the replays add none, because a replay re-runs recorded NODES rather than the
host dispatch. The recorded arm-D call took the split-K branch at P=2.

And with a live-aliasing probe in place it FAILS: **`live buffers written
through: 1/16`.** One 512KB buffer, allocated after the graph was built and
still held by us, was written through while the graph replayed. Exactly one —
one workspace-sized block, one claimant.

So `multistage_gemm` does what its source says: allocates the reduction
workspace with `ctx.enqueue_create_buffer`, which `recording_context` FORWARDS
to the backing context, and frees it at `_ = work_space_data^` while the
recorded node keeps the raw pointer. **The GEMM's own answer stays right
(4.14263630 on all three replays) because the kernel writes that workspace
before `split_k_reduce` reads it, inside one graph, in order. What it destroys
is whatever the allocator handed the block to next.**

That is strictly worse than stream capture, which aborts the process on this
shape ([[_split_k_cannot_be_cuda_graph_captured]]). Here nothing raises,
nothing crashes, the checksum is correct, and an unrelated tensor is silently
overwritten. **ACT issues ~46 split-K GEMMs per step; recording one would put
46 stray writers into live memory and the loss would just be wrong.**

## The three vacuity holes this arm went through, because they are the lesson

I predicted this failure in the first draft, then MEASURED A PASS TWICE, and
both passes were my own test being blind. Each fix found the next hole:

  1. **the churn could not reach the block** — until `_pool_recycles` proved
     the allocator reissues a freed 512KB block (`YES`);
  2. **the recorded call might never have split K** — `select_config` is a
     CHOOSER, not the dispatch gate
     ([[_select_config_is_not_the_dispatch_gate]]), and both branches print
     the same number. Only the kernel log separated them;
  3. **the poison was FREED before the replay** — so nothing owned that memory,
     and the split-K kernel simply overwrote it. A dangling-but-mapped pointer
     yields the RIGHT ANSWER. Stage 2 could only ever catch an UNMAP, which
     MAX's pool never does.

⚠ **GENERAL SHAPE, worth more than this arm:** a scratch buffer that is
written-then-read INSIDE one graph cannot be caught by poisoning it beforehand.
Poison something that OUTLIVES the replay and check it afterwards. And the
probe prints the VALUE it found beside the expected partial sum, because a
count is not an identity — "something wrote here" has several authors,
`K/P * a * b` has one.

⚠ **E is a launch-overhead CEILING, not a step.** 32 trivial kernels: 3.14 ->
0.89 us per launch, and the replay figure carries one synchronize for the whole
chain. A real step's kernels do work that overlaps the launch
([[_a_per_call_sweep_is_an_upper_bound_on_a_step]]: a per-call sweep predicted
+0.57ms and the step moved +0.06ms, 10x over).

⚠ **Arm E CRASHED on the first 5090 run, and it was this file's bug.**
`CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` at `AsyncRT_DeviceContext_release`: `buf`'s last
mention was the `LayoutTensor` construction, so Mojo freed the DeviceBuffer
there and every launch wrote through a dangling view. Arms A and B were saved
only by happening to read `buf` back at the end — **the bug is invisible in an
arm that checks its value.** Fixed by a closing read-back that also asserts the
launch arithmetic.

⚠ **The runs do NOT prove the "no LD_PRELOAD" claim.** `[intercept] Mojo
stream: 0x...` appears in their output: `pixi run -e nvidia` applies the nvidia
activation, which preloads `libcuda_intercept.so` whether or not anything uses
it ([[_the_preload_is_a_property_of_the_process_not_the_binary]]). This file
never calls it; the built-binary line at the top is what SHOWS that.

## Reading the result

    0,A,B pass                 DeviceGraph is live here. The shim is replaceable
                               for hand-written kernel sequences at minimum.
    C passes                   library calls record. Port `maybe_capture_replay`
                               onto `DeviceGraph` — the closure signature has to
                               grow a `DeviceContext` argument (today it captures
                               one), which is the whole migration.
    C fails                    the interesting failure. Report WHICH call raised;
                               a `synchronize()` inside a library path would do
                               it, and `recording_context()` raises on host waits
                               by design.
    D fails (as predicted)     unchanged conclusion: own the split-K workspace.
                               DeviceGraph does not rescue split-K by itself, it
                               just fails differently (silently, not loudly).
    D passes                   then MAX routes that allocation somewhere better
                               than its docstring implies — re-check
                               `_split_k_cannot_be_cuda_graph_captured`.

⚠ Off NVIDIA this file compiles and runs but there is NO VERDICT: Metal supports
neither stream capture nor device graphs ([[_the_metal_launch_floor_is_command_
buffer_retirement]]). Every arm is expected to RAISE on Apple, and the arm
harness reports that as "unsupported here", not as a failure. Run it on the
5090 for an answer.

def arm_f(ctx: DeviceContext) raises -> Bool:
    """The VENDOR path — the shape ACT's conv GEMMs actually land on.

    ⚠ THIS ARM EXISTS BECAUSE ARMS C AND D CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTION. Both use
    shapes that PASS `multi_gemm_cond` (`m>1 and n%128==0 and k%32==0 and
    k>=128`, matmul/gpu/__init__.mojo:591), so neither ever reaches the vendor
    branch. `[256 x 64] @ [64 x 256]` fails on `k >= 128` — k=64, exactly ACT's
    `k = OC = 64` — and routes to `matmul_vendor`, which allocates **32MB per
    call** at `blas.mojo:780`.

    Under STREAM capture that allocation raises (empty `graphFreeList`, no
    driver fallback), MAX CATCHES it in a try/except at
    matmul/gpu/__init__.mojo:1373, logs "Vendor BLAS failed", and falls through
    to `matmul_kernel_naive` at BLOCK_DIM=16. Correct results, much slower —
    which is why a stream-captured ACT step comes out SLOWER than eager.

    ⚠ **THE PREDICTION HERE IS THE OPPOSITE, AND IT IS NOT A GUESS ABOUT THE
    POOL.** `recording_context()` does not seed `graphFreeList`; its docstring
    says buffer allocation FORWARDS TO THE BACKING CONTEXT. So the 32MB
    allocation should SUCCEED — as a plain eager allocation, not a graph-scoped
    one — meaning no raise, no "Vendor BLAS failed", and NO naive fallback. The
    32MB is then freed when the call returns while the recorded node keeps its
    pointer, i.e. the same silent aliasing arm D caught, 64x larger.

    So "does DeviceGraph make the allocation problem dissolve?" has a third
    answer besides yes and no: **the allocation stops failing and starts
    corrupting.** The probe therefore runs at 32MB — same-size bucket reuse is
    what `_pool_recycles` demonstrated, so a poison buffer must MATCH the
    allocation to be a plausible recipient of its block.

    Read it with `-D LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO`:
      "Vendor BLAS failed" present  -> the allocation DID fail here too; expect
                                      `matmul_kernel_naive` in the profile and
                                      DeviceGraph inherits the slowdown.
      absent, and `live buffers written through` > 0

    #     `buf` down here, its last use is the `LayoutTensor` construction
    #     above — so the DeviceBuffer is freed there and every launch in this
    #     arm, eager and replayed alike, writes through a dangling `lt`. Arms A
    #     and B never hit it only because they happen to read `buf` back at the
    #     end. `mojo_rl/cuda/graph.mojo:54` and this file's own `_Gemm` docstring
    #     both state the rule; the timing arm was written without applying it.
    #
    # (b) VACUITY. A timing arm that never checks a value is happy to report a
    #     beautiful speedup for launches that did nothing. WARM eager + WARM
    #     replayed + TIMED eager + TIMED replayed passes of CHAIN increments is
    #     an exact integer, so it either lands on it or something did not run.
