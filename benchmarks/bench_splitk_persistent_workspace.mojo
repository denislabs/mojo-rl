"""Split-K GEMM with a CALLER-OWNED workspace — the alloc-free, capturable variant.

Context: `docs/MODULAR_MATMUL_ALLOC_REPORT.md` Measurements 4 and 5.
`linalg.matmul.gpu.multistage_gemm` allocates its split-K reduction
workspace on every call (matmul/gpu/__init__.mojo:1845) and frees it at
the end of the call. That costs ~250 us of cuMemAlloc/cuMemFree per GEMM
and makes the GEMM impossible to put inside a CUDA-graph capture.

The report asked Modular to reuse that workspace. This file shows we do
not have to wait for them: every piece `multistage_gemm` uses on that
branch is exported from the SHIPPED `linalg` package, so we can inline
the same ~40 lines against a buffer we own.

  from linalg.matmul.gpu import multistage_gemm_split_k_kernel, split_k_reduce
  from linalg.utils_gpu   import MatmulConfig, MatmulKernels, select_config

Verified importable against MAX 26.5.0 / Mojo 1.0.0 (ed45d567).

  arm A   linalg.matmul                      allocates (baseline)
  arm B   splitk_gemm + SplitKWorkspace      no allocation
  arm C   arm B inside a CUDA-graph capture  the thing Measurement 5 blocked

Run (NVIDIA only — the multistage kernel does not build for Metal):

    pixi run -e nvidia mojo run -I . benchmarks/bench_splitk_persistent_workspace.mojo
    pixi run -e nvidia mojo run -D LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO -I . \
        benchmarks/bench_splitk_persistent_workspace.mojo

`-D LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO` makes MAX name the path it took and print
"K partitions: N" for each call. It is a COMPILE-TIME define; the
same-named environment variable does nothing (verified).
