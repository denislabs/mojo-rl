"""Does a split-K GEMM abort CUDA-graph capture?

## Why this is the first thing to run

`docs/ACT_GPU_DATA_PATH.md` proposes moving ACT's data path onto the device and
then capturing the training step. Every prerequisite is either already done or
ours to fix — except one, and it is not ours.

MAX's split-K allocates its reduction workspace PER CALL:

    // matmul/gpu/__init__.mojo:1845
    if runtime_config.num_k_partitions > 1:
        var work_space_data = ctx.enqueue_create_buffer[work_space_type](
            runtime_config.num_k_partitions * M * N
        )

and in the nsys trace those land as `cuMemAlloc_v2` — the SYNCHRONOUS driver
allocator, not `cuMemAllocAsync`. A synchronous allocation inside a capture
region is illegal on CUDA and aborts the capture. ACT hits
`multistage_gemm_split_k` about **46 times per step** (its dW GEMMs,
`grad_w = xᵀ @ go`, where K is `batch x tokens`), so if that reasoning holds,
CUDA graphs for ACT are blocked until Modular reuses that workspace.

It also explains why SAC captures fine today: its MLP GEMMs are small and
square-ish, so `select_config` never partitions K.

⚠ **That is a chain of inference, not a measurement.** MAX may special-case
capture, or its `_DeviceBufferMode._ASYNC` buffers may reach a stream-ordered
pool that nsys reports differently. This file settles it in one run instead of
building a plan on top of a guess.

## What it does

Three capture attempts through the repo's own `maybe_capture_replay`, so the
lifecycle is exactly the one the training drivers use:

  A. a NON-split-K GEMM  — the control. If this fails, the harness is wrong,
     not the hypothesis.
  B. a split-K GEMM      — `[256 x 2592] @ [2592 x 256]`, confirmed to pick
     `multistage_gemm_split_k` in `bench_matmul_alloc_splitk_and_bmm.mojo`.
  C. B again, after a warm-up call outside capture — in case the allocation is
     a one-off that a settled stream avoids.

## Reading it

    A ok, B ok, C ok      -> NOT blocked. Capture allocates fine (or MAX pools
                             it). Proceed with the plan in ACT_GPU_DATA_PATH.
    A ok, B fails         -> BLOCKED, as reasoned. The Modular report stops
                             being a 22% tax and becomes the gate on a whole
                             optimization; say so when filing.
    A ok, B fails, C ok   -> the allocation is first-call only. Warm every
                             shape before capture and the plan survives.
    A fails               -> harness problem. Ignore B and C.

⚠ A "pass" here means capture COMPLETED, not that replay is correct. If B
passes, the next question is whether the replayed graph reuses a workspace that
was freed after capture — which would be a silent wrong-answer bug, not a
crash. Every arm therefore checks the output against its ANALYTIC value
(`K * 0.01 * 0.02` per element) and reports a mismatch as "the step did not
run", because a capture that silently computes nothing would otherwise look
exactly like a pass. The first draft of this file did precisely that on an M1.

⚠ On NVIDIA, `maybe_capture_replay` already runs `STEP()` once and
synchronizes BEFORE it captures a second run — so all three arms get a warm-up
there, and C differs only in having also allocated and freed the workspace
three times first. C stays because "the allocation is a first-call artifact"
and "the allocation is fine under capture" are different answers.

⚠ UNEXPLAINED, and only on the no-op path: on Apple, where
`maybe_capture_replay` reduces to a bare `STEP()`, arms A and B compute
nothing at all while C (which makes direct calls first) computes correctly.
Since NVIDIA takes the other branch and warms up on its own, this does not
affect the verdict — but it means an Apple run of this file cannot be used to
sanity-check the harness, and the "HARNESS is wrong" line it prints there is
that anomaly, not a defect in the arms.
