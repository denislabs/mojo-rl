"""Does `linalg.matmul` care whether the CONTRACTION dim K is a multiple of 16?

## Why this exists

On Apple/Metal (M1 Pro, 2026-08-12) `max_matmul` falls off a ~10x cliff the
moment `K % 16 != 0`, and it is the dominant cost of TD-MPC2's MPPI planner and
of its world-model training rollout:

    [268 x 512] @ [512 x 512]   162 us    867 GFLOPS
    [268 x 518] @ [518 x 512]  1339 us    106 GFLOPS     <- same FLOPs, 8x slower
    [268 x 528] @ [528 x 512]   143 us   1011 GFLOPS

518 is not an arbitrary number: it is `ZA = LATENT + ACT` = 512 + 6, the input
width of TD-MPC2's dynamics trunk, reward trunk and every Q head. Any
`(obs | act)` concatenation feeding a critic has the same problem, and so does
`BINS = 101` whenever a two-hot logit vector is used as an input width.

## The decision this benchmark exists to make

Padding K costs something when it does not help: a copy kernel and a padded
weight slab per `Linear` whose `IN_ % 16 != 0`. So the padding policy in
`mojo_rl/nn/primitives/linear.mojo` should be keyed on a MEASUREMENT, not on a
guess, and not on the platform. **The number that decides it is the RATIO**
(unaligned time / padded time) — it is backend-independent, unlike GFLOPS,
which needs a per-device peak to interpret.

    ratio >> 1  ->  the cliff is real here; pad.
    ratio ~ 1   ->  the library already absorbs unaligned K; do not pad,
                    the copy would be pure overhead.
    ratio < 1   ->  padding COSTS time here; definitely do not pad.

⚠ The Apple numbers quoted above are a REFERENCE, not an expectation. cuBLAS
pads internally and may well absorb this entirely, in which case the right
answer is an Apple-only default — but that is exactly what has not been
measured yet, and a permanent platform branch is too expensive to add on a
hunch.

⚠ This measures `linalg.matmul` DIRECTLY on raw device buffers, so nothing here
is attributable to the `Tensor` / `Param` plumbing in `nn`. The isolated
per-GEMM saving also does NOT transfer 1:1 to an end-to-end agent number — see
the assessment in the commit that added this file: padding bought 2.27x on the
full TD-MPC2 planner at 1024 samples but only 1.21x at 256, where the
~700-launch dependent kernel chain becomes the binding constraint instead.
