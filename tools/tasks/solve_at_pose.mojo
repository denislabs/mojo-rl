"""ONE LIBERO STATE, ONE ELLIPTIC SOLVE, THREE LEGS — which one is wrong?

    # the state comes from the family driver:
    #   libero_family_batched --dump-at-step 1 --dump-state build/diag/lr3_step1.txt
    pixi run mojo run -I . tools/tasks/solve_at_pose.mojo build/diag/lr3_step1.txt 0

## ⚠⚠ THE ANSWER FOR ONE SOLVE — AND READ THE SCOPE BELOW

At this state the blocked elliptic kernel is NOT the worse of the two legs.
On the reproduction state (`libero_living_room_scene3`, step 1):

    lane 0   per-env 10 iters / 147 line-search evals   blocked 10 / 148
    worst |qacc| between the two float32 legs           5.72e-06
    worst |qacc - CPU float64 reference|   per-env 9.109e-03   blocked 9.103e-03
    reference max |qacc| 37.2 m/s^2   =>   both 2.4e-04 RELATIVE, ratio 0.9994

The two legs differ from each other by ~1600x LESS than they each differ from
the truth, and the blocked leg is the marginally nearer one. The gap they
share is float32 against float64 on a converged solve — all three legs
converge, in 10 iterations, well inside the model's budget of 100.

⚠ LANE 1 IS THE CONTROL AND IT WAS NOT PLANNED. There the two float32 legs
are BIT-IDENTICAL (both 8.980136837440256e-03 from the reference) and the gap
to float64 is the SAME size. A difference that survives when the accused
kernel agrees with its accuser is not that kernel's difference.

## ⚠⚠ THE SCOPE: THIS IS ONE SOLVE, NOT A ROLLOUT

Nothing above is an acquittal of the blocked kernel. It says only that at THIS
state, for ONE solve, the blocked leg is not the worse of the two. The rollout
says something different and the next section is why.

## ⚠⚠ THE ROLLOUT ARM COMPARISON IS AN ACCURACY COMPARISON — IT COUNTS

`libero_family_batched`'s CPU leg is `comptime H = DType.float64`, so the 5090
run that put blocked at 0.04190795940899783 and per-env at 0.0018 measured both
against a FLOAT64 reference. Both numbers are `alphabet_soup_1_joint0[2]` —
that body's z — at step 4. So over a rollout the blocked leg is genuinely ~23x
further from the truth than the per-env leg, and this file's single-solve
result does NOT excuse that.

⚠ AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS HEADER SAID THOSE ARMS WERE SCORED AGAINST A
FLOAT32 CPU LEG and therefore ranked by summation order rather than accuracy.
That was wrong — it confused this file's `_solve64`/float32 pair with the
family gate's float64 leg. The order-of-summation argument applies to THIS
file's two GPU legs, not to the family gate's verdict.

## ⚠ HOW BOTH RESULTS CAN BE TRUE AT ONCE

One solve: the legs are 5.7e-06 apart and both 9.1e-03 from float64.
One rollout: the legs are 0.042 and 0.0018 from float64.

Two readings survive that, and they call for different fixes:

1. **A knife edge.** The 5.7e-06 decides a DISCRETE event over 125 substeps —
   a box on the table tips or does not — and which side you land on is not an
   accuracy property. Then a one-ULP perturbation of the PER-ENV leg would
   also throw it to ~0.04, and the scene, not the kernel, is the problem.
2. **A BIAS.** If the blocked leg's per-solve error is systematic rather than
   random — say it consistently over-supports a resting contact — then 5.7e-06
   a solve integrates into 0.04 over the window while per-env's unbiased error
   does not. Then the blocked kernel IS wrong and the single solve above was
   too blunt to see it, because it reports `worst |.|` and a bias needs a
   SIGNED mean.

The signed-mean column below settles that the difference IS systematic
(|mean|/mean|.| = 0.975 over 90 dofs, where random rounding sits near 0.1).
What it does NOT settle is whether that systematic offset is a ROUNDING bias —
two assembly orders, or FMA contraction applied in one leg and not the other,
both of which are one-directional — or a genuine logic difference.

⚠⚠ THE TEST FOR THAT IS NOT RUNNABLE ON METAL, AND THE VACUOUS VERSION OF IT
LOOKS LIKE A PASS. See `_solve64`: `solve_newton_blocked["cpu", ...]` falls
back to the per-env body, so a CPU float64 leg-vs-leg sweep compares a function
with itself and prints 0.0 at every iteration. It needs a CUDA box, where
`solve_newton_blocked["gpu", DType.float64]` is a real second implementation.

## WHY A STEPPING RUN CANNOT ANSWER THIS EITHER

`libero_family_batched --solver-log` shows the two legs bit-identical through
step 1 and diverging at step 2, the line-search work first (cumulative
evaluations 2997 against 3006) while the state still matches to six digits.
After that every difference is downstream of the first, so a rollout says only
THAT they part. This replays ONE state through both, with identical inputs.

`tests/physics3d/test_newton_blocked_elliptic.mojo` does the same for a slam
chain of capsules and asserts bit equality — and PASSES. LIBERO is boxes
resting at the contact margin, 18 contacts a lane, which that fixture never
produces. The pre-solve pipeline below is its `_prep`, verbatim, for that
reason: the two files must feed their solves the same way.

## ⚠ THE DIVERGENCE FOLLOWS THE STATE, NOT THE LANE SLOT

Commit 4412f5b81's message says it "needs two lanes". THAT IS WRONG and this
file is the correction: lane 1's state placed in slot 0 reproduces it at
BATCH 1. Two lanes are still carried below, for the separate reason that a
per-env indexing mistake in a one-block-per-env kernel cannot show at BATCH 1
— and lane 1 earned its keep as the control above.

## HOW THE ITERATION SWEEP LOCALISED IT

Capping the Newton budget at k and comparing the k-th iterate: bit-identical
through k=6; at k=7 BOTH legs do identical work (7 iterations, 127 evaluations
each) and the answers already differ by 2.384e-07 — one float32 ULP. The extra
evaluation at k=8 is a CONSEQUENCE of that ULP, not its cause, which is what
retires the line search as a suspect.

## ⚠ max_contacts IS LOWERED TO FIT METAL

`libero_living_room_scene3` at 64 asks for 32 852 B of threadgroup memory and
Metal's limit is 32 768 — 84 bytes over. At 56 it fits, and the family's
measured contact peak is 28 (`contact_budget.kv`), so nothing is truncated.
Both legs run at the SAME cap, which is what the comparison needs.
