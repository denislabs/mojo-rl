"""A project — a directory, a `project.kv`, and a naming authority.

`docs/PROJECT_LAYER_PLAN.md` §3-§4. It owns nothing computational: it is a
container for a definition (which env, which tasks, which datasets) plus the
runs made under it.

⚠⚠ THE DEFINITION IS TRACKED; THE RUNS ARE NOT. `project.kv` and the pointers
beside it are a few KB of text saying exactly what a run was — that is the
reproducibility story, and ignoring it would leave the recipe on one laptop's
filesystem, which is the pain being fixed one level up. Only `runs/`, blobs and
materialised weights are ignored (`.gitignore`).

⚠ IT REFERENCES `.family` AND `.task`; IT NEVER REDEFINES THEM. The task layer
owns those. A project that copied them would fork the definition, and the fork
is invisible until two runs disagree about what a task was.

## The `ref=` line, and why it carries a commit

    ref=family:so101_tabletop:mojo_rl/tasks/families/so101_tabletop.family@081b53c0
    ref=task:so101_reach_brick:mojo_rl/tasks/tasks/so101_reach_brick.task@081b53c0

`<kind>:<name>:<path>@<commit>`, one repeating key — the same colon-separated
shape `tasks/spec.mojo`'s `region=` already uses, and `split_once` reads it
without losing a path that contains `:`.

⚠⚠ THE `@<commit>` IS THE WHOLE POINT AND THE FIRST PASS OMITTED IT. Decision 11
chose a reference over a copy on the reversibility argument — a reference can be
materialised later, whereas un-forking a drifted copy is a merge. But an
UNPINNED reference resolves against whatever the working tree happens to be, so
a `.family` that drifted makes `run.kv` a lie about what was trained. That is
this layer's own failure mode, reintroduced one level up.

⚠ THE PIN IS CHECKED, NOT ENFORCED. `check_refs` reports drift; it does not
refuse to run. A box at a different commit is the normal case during
development, and a project layer that blocked a run over it would be turned off.
