"""`key=value` text — the shared reader for this tree's own file formats.

Several formats here are a flat block of `key=value` lines with one or more
REPEATING keys: `data/manifest.mojo` (`column=`), checkpoint v2, `core/dotenv`,
and now `tasks/spec.mojo` (`slot=`, `region=`, `active=`, `init=`). The parsing
is four lines each and has been written three times.

⚠ THIS IS THE HOME FOR NEW READERS, NOT YET A MIGRATION. `data/manifest._split`
and `core/dotenv._split_lines` are the two older private copies. Moving them
here is a separate change on the DATA path — the manifest lives inside every
`.h5` this tree has written — and is not worth bundling into a task-layer
commit. **Do not add a fourth copy.**

## ⚠ BYTE-WISE ON PURPOSE

Every one of these formats is ASCII by construction. Splitting by codepoint
would make a stray UTF-8 byte a slicing error somewhere far from the line that
carried it; `_a_byte_slice_of_a_string_asserts_a_codepoint_boundary` is the
recorded shape. The one field that is legitimately human text — a task's
`language=` instruction — is carried through as bytes and never split.

# not import back; keeping this leaf dependency-free is what lets anything in the
# tree read and write the format without dragging `io/` in behind it.

# emits `prefix=value` lines for checkpoint v2. It is on the checkpoint hot
# path, it has typed emitters per scalar kind, and every `.ckpt` in the tree is
# in its format — so it is the same "separate change on the DATA path" this
# file's header already reserves for `data/manifest._split`. Recorded so the
