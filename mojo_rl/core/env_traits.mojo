"""Environment trait hierarchy for different state/action space types.

This module defines traits that categorize environments by their state and action
space types, enabling compile-time checking of algorithm-environment compatibility.

Trait Hierarchy:
    Env (base)
    ├── DiscreteStateEnv   - States can be converted to integer indices
    ├── ContinuousStateEnv - States are continuous observation vectors (List[Float64])
    ├── DiscreteActionEnv  - Actions are discrete integers
    └── ContinuousActionEnv - Actions are continuous vectors

Combined Traits:
    DiscreteEnv           = DiscreteStateEnv & DiscreteActionEnv
    BoxDiscreteActionEnv  = ContinuousStateEnv & DiscreteActionEnv
    BoxContinuousActionEnv = ContinuousStateEnv & ContinuousActionEnv

GPU Environment Traits (Experimental):
    GPUDiscreteEnv    - GPU-compatible discrete action environments (e.g., LunarLander)
    GPUContinuousEnv  - GPU-compatible continuous action environments (e.g., CarRacing)

Environments implement combinations:
    GridWorld:   DiscreteEnv (tabular)
    CartPole:    DiscreteEnv + BoxDiscreteActionEnv (4D obs)
    MountainCar: DiscreteEnv + BoxDiscreteActionEnv (2D obs)
    Acrobot:     DiscreteEnv + BoxDiscreteActionEnv (6D obs)
    Pendulum:    DiscreteEnv + BoxContinuousActionEnv (3D obs, 1D action)
    LunarLander: BoxDiscreteActionEnv + GPUDiscreteEnv (8D obs, 4 actions)
    CarRacing:   BoxContinuousActionEnv + GPUContinuousEnv (13D obs, 3D action)

Algorithms specify requirements:
    Q-Learning (tabular): DiscreteEnv
    Tile-coded Q-Learning: BoxDiscreteActionEnv
    PPO:                   BoxDiscreteActionEnv (or BoxContinuousActionEnv)
    SAC/DDPG/TD3:          BoxContinuousActionEnv
    GPU DQN:               GPUDiscreteEnv
    GPU SAC/DDPG/TD3:      GPUContinuousEnv

# Renderable Environment Trait
# ============================================================================


trait RenderableEnv:
    """Trait for environments that support visualization.

    This trait enables environment-owned rendering, where the environment
    manages its own renderer internally. This decouples algorithms from
    specific renderer types (2D vs 3D) and allows a unified rendering
    interface across all environments.

    Benefits:
    - Algorithms don't need to know about renderer types
    - Same `render: Bool` parameter works for all environments
    - Rendering details stay encapsulated within the environment
    - Environments can use whatever renderer is appropriate (2D or 3D)

    Usage in algorithms:
        def evaluate[E: BoxContinuousActionEnv & RenderableEnv](
            self, mut env: E, render: Bool = False
        ):
            if render:

            for episode in range(num_episodes):
                # ... episode loop ...
                if render:
                    env.render_frame()
                    if env.check_renderer_quit():
                        break
