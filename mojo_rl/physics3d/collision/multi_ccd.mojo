"""Multi-point convex contact — MuJoCo's `mjc_MultiCCD` (defect 21).

A convex-convex narrow phase that returns ONE point cannot hold a flat contact:
the body rotates about that point and sinks. MuJoCo's answer is to find the
first contact, then re-run the SAME query four more times with the two geoms
TILTED slightly about the axes perpendicular to the contact normal, keeping
whichever new points are distinct. A cylinder resting on a box goes from 1 row
to 5.

Ported from `references/mujoco-3.11.0/src/engine/engine_collision_convex.c`
:881-935 (`mjc_Convex`'s tail). 3.11.0 is the closest tree to the 3.10.0
runtime; the older trees differ on this in a way that matters — see the flag
note below.

    relative_tolerance = 1e-3;  perturbation_angle = 1e-3;
    frame = makeFrame(con[0].normal);
    tolerance = relative_tolerance * min(geom_rbound[g1], geom_rbound[g2]);
    axes = {frame+3, frame+6};  angles = {-1e-3, +1e-3};
    for axis, angle:
        rot = axisAngle2Mat(axis, angle);
        rotate g1 about con[0].pos by rot;
        rotate g2 about con[0].pos by rot^T;      // INVERSELY
        n = penetration(g1, g2, 1 contact);
        if n and isDistinctContact(con, ncon+1, tolerance):
            con[ncon].dist = con[0].dist;         // COPIED, not measured
            ncon += 1;
        restore g1, g2;

⚠ `con[ncon].dist = con[0].dist` is not an optimisation. The perturbed query
measures a penetration at a TILTED pose, which is not the penetration at the
real pose; MuJoCo overwrites it with the first point's. Keeping the measured
value makes every extra row slightly wrong and the manifold asymmetric. It is
also directly observable: all five rows of a cylinder/capsule contact report
dist exactly -0.005000 at a 5 mm fixture.

⚠⚠ THE ENABLE FLAG INVERTED BETWEEN VERSIONS, and reading the wrong tree gets
this backwards. MuJoCo 3.6.0 has `mjENBL_MULTICCD` (1<<4) — OPT-IN, off by
default. The 3.10.0 runtime and the 3.11.0 tree have `mjDSBL_MULTICCD` (1<<19)
— a DISABLE bit, so the feature is ON by default. We implement the default-on
behaviour, unconditionally, because that is what the runtime we gate against
does. Measured: with `opt.disableflags = 0` the reference emits 31 contacts on
`tests/physics3d/narrow_phase_pairs_ref.py`; with `mjDSBL_MULTICCD` it emits 15,
which is exactly what this engine emitted before this file existed.

⚠ SPHERE AND ELLIPSOID ARE EXCLUDED by MuJoCo's own guard, and that is not an
oversight to "fix": a sphere or ellipsoid touches a convex body at ONE point,
so a tilted requery finds the same point again and the manifold is a single
row by geometry. Dog's 44 collidable ellipsoids are unaffected, as are fish,
swimmer and humanoid_CMU whose only convex geoms are ellipsoids. Measured:
mesh/sphere is 1 row in the reference too.

SCOPE: the pairs `mjc_Convex` sends through this loop, which is decided by a
SECOND guard sitting in front of it (`engine_collision_convex.c:875`):

    int max_contacts = maxContacts(m, &obj1, &obj2);
    int ncon = mjc_penetration(..., max_contacts, margin);
    if (!mjDISABLED(mjDSBL_NATIVECCD) && max_contacts > 1) return ncon;

`maxContacts` (`:843`) gives 8 for BOX x BOX, 4 when BOTH geoms are box-or-mesh,
and 1 for everything else; `mjDSBL_NATIVECCD` is a DISABLE bit that is off by
default. So on the 3.10.0 runtime:

  * BOX x BOX, BOX x MESH, MESH x MESH -> take the early return. Their manifold
    comes from `multicontact()` (`engine_collision_gjk.c:2111`), which clips the
    two contacting polygons and prunes to a max-area quad, and which needs mesh
    polygon topology (`mesh_polynum`) that our `mesh_meta` does not carry. NOT
    PORTED, deliberately, and NOT to be faked here.
  * everything else, INCLUDING MESH x CYLINDER and MESH x CAPSULE -> reaches
    this loop, because only one of the two geoms is box-or-mesh.

⚠⚠ THAT SPLIT WAS GOT WRONG TWICE IN THIS FILE'S HISTORY, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.
First a design note claimed MuJoCo's only exclusions were sphere and ellipsoid,
which would have routed box/mesh here; then the correction to it over-swung and
claimed mesh pairs never reach this loop at all, which would have left
mesh/cylinder at a single point forever. Measured against the runtime at ~5 mm
of overlap — MuJoCo's row count vs ours:

    block.stl / cylinder   5 vs 1      block.stl / box    4 vs 1  (native)
    block.stl / capsule    5 vs 1      block.stl / mesh   4 vs 1  (native)
    gripper   / cylinder   4 vs 1      gripper   / box    2 vs 1  (native)
    gripper   / capsule    2 vs 1      gripper   / mesh   1 vs 1
    either    / sphere     1 vs 1

⚠ THE OBVIOUS DISCRIMINATOR IS CONFOUNDED AND GAVE THE WRONG ANSWER FIRST.
Toggling `mjDSBL_MULTICCD` collapses EVERY pair above to a single row, which
reads as "they all come from this loop" — but `maxContacts` itself branches on
that bit (`return mjDISABLED(mjDSBL_MULTICCD) ? 1 : 4`), so disabling it also
switches the native path off. The path is decided by geom TYPE, not by that
flag.
