"""Physics3D shared type leaves.

The legacy struct-of-Lists `Model`/`Data` (MuJoCo-style CPU engine state) were
deleted at the G4 fields sunset — the engine state is `fields.Model` /
`fields.Data` (packed per-record tensors). What remains here are the
tiny shared leaves: `_max_one`, the equality-constraint type codes, and
`ConeType`.
