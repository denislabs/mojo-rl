"""`mj_solNoSlip` — the friction-only post-solver sweep (BOTH cones).

WIRED IN: `solver/newton_solve.mojo` calls `noslip_pyramidal` from its
PYRAMIDAL per-env path (2026-08-03) and `noslip_elliptic` from its ELLIPTIC one
(2026-08-13), each under `comptime if NOSLIP_ITER > 0`, with `NOSLIP_ITER`
threaded from `<option noslip_iterations>` via `ModelDefFromXML` ->
`Phyics3dEnv` -> `EulerIntegrator` -> `solve_newton`.

⚠ THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS OVER DIFFERENT ROW LAYOUTS, not one routine
with a flag — see the header on each. The dispatch is therefore a real
obligation on the caller: routing a model to the wrong one would apply the
wrong friction law rather than fail. `newton_solve` dispatches inside the
already-cone-split solve bodies, so the two cannot be confused.

GATES
  * pyramidal: `tests/physics3d/test_noslip_vs_mujoco.mojo` (compiles, runs,
    and does not perturb an already-converged solve — the pass is INERT on
    that fixture and the file says so) and dm_control's dog, where it bites.
    ⚠ That file gates the PER-ENV path only. The blocked NVIDIA kernel is
    gated separately by `tests/physics3d/test_noslip_blocked_kernel.mojo`,
    because for a long time it ran neither and nothing noticed.
  * elliptic: `tests/physics3d/test_noslip_elliptic_vs_mujoco.mojo`, a
    3-capsule chain SLAMMED into the floor at 40 m/s while sliding, where
    MuJoCo-against-MuJoCo with only the option changed moves `qacc` by
    **9.8e+1** — the pass is first-order there, so the gate can fail. That
    file also records which fixtures do NOT work and why: a hard normal
    impulse is the ingredient, not contact count, and every gently resting
    fixture is inert to round-off.
    ⚠ That fixture is condim 3, so it only reaches `mju_QCQP2`. The other two
    dispatches ride on `tests/physics3d/test_elliptic_condim46_vs_mujoco.mojo`,
    whose spinning ball runs the pass at condim 4 and 6 — MuJoCo moves `qacc`
    by 3.0e+1 and 3.6e+2 there with only `noslip_iterations` changed, so
    `mju_QCQP3` and `mju_QCQP` are exercised rather than merely compiled.

WHAT IT IS

After the primal solve converges, MuJoCo optionally runs a Gauss-Seidel sweep
over the FRICTION dimensions only, with the normal forces held fixed, to
remove residual slip. dm_control's dog asks for it in the suite
(`<option timestep="0.005" noslip_iterations="4"/>`), and EVERY manipulation
model asks for it with the elliptic cone
(`<option cone="elliptic" noslip_iterations="5" noslip_tolerance="0"/>`).

It is NOT a refinement that can be skipped. Measured MuJoCo-against-MuJoCo with
only the option changed:

  * dog (pyramidal): `max|d(qvel)|` **2.9e-2 on the FIRST contacting step**.
  * `reach_site_features` (elliptic): `max|d(qacc)|` **7.4e+2 on step 1**, at
    55 contacts. Not a tail correction — the same order as the answer.

(Multi-step numbers prove nothing on their own — a contact-rich rollout is
chaotic and any perturbation grows. The first-step number is the one that
settles it, because there is nothing yet to amplify.)

VERSION DRIFT: none that reaches us. `mj_solNoSlip` is byte-identical across
MuJoCo 3.3.6, 3.6.0 and main; 3.11.0 refactors it into a static `solNoSlip`
with island support, hoists `dualFinish` to the caller (which still runs it
whenever `noslip_iterations > 0`, `engine_forward.c:1152`) and moves the
elliptic QCQP block into `solveQCQP`/`projectEllipsoid` helpers — all three
changes are structural, and the arithmetic is unchanged. So the runtime's
3.10.0, which no tree here matches, is bracketed rather than guessed at. See
`feedback_reference_tree_version_drift`. Transcribed from
`engine_solver.c:537` (3.6.0) / `:767` (3.11.0).

THE TWO SIMPLIFICATIONS THAT MAKE THIS TRACTABLE

MuJoCo works in the DUAL formulation and needs `efc_AR = J M^-1 J^T + R`, a
dense `nefc x nefc` matrix we do not build. Both of its uses collapse:

  * `residual(..., flg_subR=1)` at row j expands to

        b_j + (AR f)_j - R_j f_j
      = (J qacc_smooth - aref)_j + (J M^-1 J^T f)_j
      = J_j (qacc_smooth + M^-1 J^T f) - aref_j
      = J_j qacc - aref_j

    which is EXACTLY the primal solver's `jar[j]`. No dual vector needed.

  * `extractBlock(..., flg_subR=1)` is `A` with `R` subtracted off the diagonal
    and the diagonal clamped to 1e-10 — i.e. plain `J_j M^-1 J_k^T`, with NO
    `R` term at all.

So the only genuinely new quantity is `M^-1 J_j^T` per row, for the in-place
`qacc` update that keeps `jar` current between blocks. `m_inv` is already a
dense NV x NV on `Data`, so that is a matvec, not a solve.

WHY THE NORMAL FORCE IS PRESERVED EXACTLY

For a pyramidal contact the friction is carried by opposing edge PAIRS
`(f_j, f_{j+1})`, and the normal contribution of a pair is
`mid = (f_j + f_{j+1})/2`. Every branch below writes the pair as
`(mid + y, mid - y)` for some `y`, so `mid` — and with it the normal force —
is invariant by construction. That is what "with the normal forces frozen"
means operationally, and it is why this cannot destabilise a contact.

SCOPE, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED

  * `noslip_pyramidal` is PYRAMIDAL only BY CONSTRUCTION and
    `noslip_elliptic` is ELLIPTIC only BY CONSTRUCTION — the cone is baked
    into each one's arithmetic and row layout, so neither takes a cone type
    and neither has anything to check at runtime.
    ⚠ THE OBLIGATION IS ON THE CALLER: the wiring must dispatch on
    `CONE_TYPE`, because calling the wrong one applies the wrong friction law
    rather than failing.
  * `scale` and `tolerance` are CALLER-SUPPLIED for both, and both must be
    MuJoCo's or the iteration count diverges. `tolerance` is
    `m->opt.noslip_tolerance` — MuJoCo's default is 1e-6, dm_control's
    manipulation models set **0** ("run every iteration"). It is parsed and
    carried in `MODEL_META_IDX_NOSLIP_TOLERANCE`; it was a hardcoded 1e-6
    until 2026-08-13. ⚠ That change is a FIDELITY fix, not a measured one: no
    fixture here can tell 0 from 1e-6 (worst 8.9e-10, and exactly 0.0 on
    `reach_site_features`). `scale` is `1 / (stat.meaninertia * max(1, nv))`,
    and `stat.meaninertia` is the mean of the mass matrix DIAGONAL —
    `engine_setconst.c:1139-1146`:

        meaninertia = (1/nv) * sum_i qM[dof_Madr[i]]

    evaluated once at model-build time. Getting either wrong does not corrupt
    the sweep, it changes WHEN the loop stops, which is a subtler and more
    annoying divergence — hence spelling it out here.
  * `noslip_pyramidal` DOES now run on `solve_newton_blocked`, the NVIDIA
    production kernel, on BOTH of its branches. Until 2026-08-13 that kernel
    accepted `NOSLIP_ITER` and never read it, so the pass ran on its CPU
    branch (which delegates to `_newton_solve_env`) and silently vanished on
    its GPU one — two branches of one function computing different physics
    from identical inputs, on the path dm_control's dog is trained on.
    `noslip_elliptic` still does not, and cannot: the blocked kernel is
    PYRAMIDAL-only and `solve_newton` will not route an elliptic model to it.
    Gate: `tests/physics3d/test_noslip_blocked_kernel.mojo`.

    ⚠ THAT WIRING IS WHY THE ROW ARRAYS BELOW ARE POINTERS. The blocked kernel
    keeps `Je`/`bias_e`/`force`/... in THREADGROUP memory (and spills `Je` to
    global on models where it does not fit), while `_newton_solve_env` holds
    per-thread `InlineArray`s. A signature naming either storage excludes the
    other caller, and copying into locals is exactly what that kernel exists
    to avoid. An address-space-parameterized pointer is what they share — see
    the note above `_minv_jt`. Do not "simplify" it back to one storage kind
    without re-reading that note; it would fork this routine in two.

⚠ THE REJECTION IS INSIDE `costChange`, NOT AT ITS CALL SITE. MuJoCo's helper
restores `force` from `oldforce` and returns 0 when the change comes out above
1e-10; the call sites just do `improvement -= costChange(...)` and look
rejection-free. Both functions here therefore test the returned change and skip
the write — reading the call site alone would have produced a solver that
happily accepts cost-increasing steps.

⚠⚠ EVERY SCALAR HERE IS `Scalar[DTYPE]`. IT USED TO BE `Float64` (2026-08-10)

This module originally widened to `Float64` internally — the natural choice,
since the arithmetic below is where MuJoCo's own solver is most sensitive to
rounding. That made the whole pass UNCOMPILABLE ON GPU:

    Function 'air.convert.f.f64.f.f32' has Metal-unsupported instructions
    Function 'mojo_rl_physics3d_solver_nosl...' has Metal-unsupported ...
    LLVM ERROR: Failed to verify LLVM IR for Metal

and `Float64` is off the table on the NVIDIA path too. Dog was then the only
model in the tree asking for this pass (`dog_xml`, `dog_fetch_xml`), so that
made "dog on GPU" and "noslip in Float64" mutually exclusive. The port is the
resolution, and it now also covers every manipulation model. The CPU path is
UNAFFECTED — it instantiates at
`DTYPE = float64`, so its arithmetic is bit-identical to before.

⚠ WHAT THE GPU PATH GIVES UP, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER. At
float32 three things below get noisier, and all three change WHEN the sweep
stops rather than what it converges to:

  * `improvement` accumulates `0.5*d*d*a_ii + d*res` over every row, then is
    compared against `tolerance` (1e-6) after scaling. A float32 sum over
    hundreds of rows carries ~1e-7 relative noise, which is the same order as
    the threshold — so the GPU may run one more or one fewer iteration than
    the CPU on the same state.
  * `_COST_REJECT` (1e-10) gates a `change` built from differences of
    products. That is catastrophic cancellation at float32, so a block the
    CPU accepts may be rejected on GPU and vice versa.
  * `k1 = a00 + a11 - a01 - a10` is a four-way cancellation feeding a
    division. When it lands under `_MINVAL` the pair is left at `mid`.

None of that can destabilise a contact — the `(mid + y, mid - y)` invariant
below is structural, not numerical, so the NORMAL force is preserved exactly
whatever the arithmetic does. It does mean a CPU-vs-GPU gate on a CONTACTING
dog should expect iteration-count divergence, which is the same regime
`test_quadruped_gpu_vs_cpu` already declines to bound.

    """One `mj_solNoSlip` call on the ELLIPTIC cone: up to `max_iter` sweeps.

    Transcribed from the `mjCNSTR_CONTACT_ELLIPTIC` branch of MuJoCo's
    `mj_solNoSlip` (`engine_solver.c:653` in 3.6.0, `solveQCQP` in 3.11.0).

    HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM THE PYRAMIDAL BRANCH — the two share a name and
    almost nothing else:

      * ROW LAYOUT. A pyramidal contact of dim d has `2*(d-1)` rows, all of
        them friction, and the normal force is only implicit in their sum.
        An elliptic contact has ONE normal row followed by `d-1` tangential
        ones. So `force[i]` here IS the normal force, and freezing it needs no
        arithmetic trick at all: the sweep simply never writes that row. The
        pyramidal `(mid + y, mid - y)` construction exists precisely because
        it has no such row to leave alone.
      * SOLVE. Pyramidal minimises a 1-D quadratic in `y` over `[-mid, mid]`,
        which is closed form. Elliptic solves a QCQP over the friction
        ellipsoid `sum (f_j/mu_j)^2 <= f_n^2` — Newton's method on the dual
        variable, not a projection.
      * A FEASIBLE ANSWER IS STILL RE-PROJECTED. When the QCQP reports the
        constraint active, MuJoCo pushes `v` back onto the ellipsoid boundary
        ("in case QCQP is approximate"). That is not a clamp — it can move a
        point that is already inside — and skipping it leaves a slowly
        drifting friction force under sustained sliding.

    ⚠ ANY CONDIM, as of 2026-08-13. This used to say "condim 3 only, because
    the SOLVER is", which was true: the primal path cached exactly three
    Jacobian rows per contact and one isotropic `mu`, so a condim-4 contact
    lost its torsional row before this function was reached, and writing the
    dim-4/5 branches here would have been unreachable code. The primal path
    now carries `dim-1` rows with per-direction friction, so all three of
    MuJoCo's dispatches are live and reachable:

        nt == 2   mju_QCQP2    condim 3   slide x2
        nt == 3   mju_QCQP3    condim 4   slide x2 + torsion
        nt == 5   mju_QCQP     condim 6   slide x2 + torsion + roll x2

    `nt == 0` is a FRICTIONLESS contact and is skipped entirely — there is no
    friction row to sweep. The QCQP3/QCQP5 instantiations are `comptime if`-ed
    on `NT` so a condim-3 model compiles exactly what it compiled before;
    QCQP5's 20-iteration Cholesky loop is not free to instantiate.

    ⚠ THE `improvement` ACCUMULATOR SPANS EVERY ROW KIND. The iteration-0
    correction is `0.5 f^2 R` over ALL `nefc` rows — contact normal AND
    tangents AND limits AND dry friction AND equalities — because MuJoCo's
    `improvement` is comparable with the primal solver's cost. Summing it over
    only the rows the sweep writes makes the loop stop on a different
    iteration, which is the one failure mode here that produces a plausible
    wrong answer rather than an obviously wrong one.

    On entry `qacc`, the `jar_*` arrays and the force arrays are the primal
    solver's converged output. On exit the TANGENTIAL forces have been
    re-solved with the normal ones frozen, and `qacc` / `qfrc` are recomputed
    from the final forces exactly as `dualFinish` does.

    # at 2.9e-04 N — and pays the full conditioning cost of `M` to do it. On

    # 0.003%, a thousandfold worse in relative terms, and it fired every
    # substep. It also explains the otherwise baffling iteration curve, which
    # is what led here: `noslip_iterations=1` was CATASTROPHIC (144.75 J of
    # peak brick kinetic energy) while 0 was clean (1.42e-04) and the shipped 5
    # partly recovered (1.58e-04). The rebuild fires at any count >= 1; only
    # repeated sweeps drag the forces back toward something it reproduces.
    #
    # ⚠ THE WARNING ABOVE STILL STANDS FOR `qfrc` AND DOES NOT APPLY HERE. A
    # from-scratch reconstruction has to re-express the normal, limit and
    # equality forces itself, which is why `qfrc` spans every row. `qacc` does
    # not need to: it still CARRIES them, because it was never discarded.
    #
    # ⚠ `qacc_smooth` IS ALREADY IN `qacc` for the same reason — it entered
    # with the Newton solution. Adding it again here would double it.
