"""Per-record tensor container for static model config (migration P1).

`Model` is the end-state replacement for the flat GPU model slab: each
record FAMILY becomes one owned packed tensor (`bodies [NBODY, 25]`,
`joints [NJOINT, 26]`, `geoms [NGEOM, 30]`, …) rather than one giant buffer.
Column indices are the existing `BODY_IDX_*` / `JOINT_IDX_*` / … constants —
after sunset they move here and become the single, local column definition.

Records stay PACKED (not one tensor per column) by design: the P0 audit +
the measured Metal operand cliff (28 ok / 29 = JIT abort) make per-column
splits of body/joint/geom records blow the kernel operand budget on the wide
kernels. Kernels bind one record tensor per entity kind and read columns —
same addressing as today's record-strided slab, minus the cross-family
offset math.

Build: `load_from_model` fills the record tensors DIRECTLY from the CPU
`Model` (`i * MODEL_<KIND>_SIZE + <KIND>_IDX_*`), no flat slab. The
transitional `load_from_slab` / `store_to_slab` bridges + the cross-family
`model_*_offset` tables were deleted at the P6 sunset.

Dtype note: all-`DTYPE` (int columns like `BODY_IDX_PARENT` are float-encoded).
Honest `int32` record tensors are a later cleanup.
