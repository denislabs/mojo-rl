"""Owned RK4 stage tensors for the per-field tensor pipeline (P2).

`Rk4Scratch` is the stateful replacement for the RK4-extra region of the
flat workspace slab (`rk4_extra_workspace_size` = NQ + 7*NV, addressed via
`ws_rk4_*_offset` in gpu/constants.mojo): one owned `TensorImpl` per
logical region, allocated once by `RK4Integrator` and reused every
step. Region inventory mirrors the legacy layout exactly:

    q0 (NQ)  — qpos saved at stage 0 (all stages integrate FROM q0)
    v0 (NV)  — qvel saved at stage 0 (C[0] = v0)
    A  (4*NV in legacy; A0/A1/A2 here) — per-stage constrained qacc.
              The legacy A[3] slot is allocated but never written: the
              combine kernel reads A[3] straight from qacc_constrained,
              and the combine REUSES the A[0] slot to hold v_combined —
              so A0 doubles as the combine's velocity buffer here too.
    C1 (NV)  — stage-2 velocity intermediate: v0 + dt/2 * A[0]
    C2 (NV)  — stage-3 velocity intermediate: v0 + dt/2 * A[1]

    ⚠ FIRST CONTAINER ON `D` (phase 1c.2), and it was chosen because it is the
    ONLY one that can go alone: `Rk4Scratch` appears in **zero** function
    signatures tree-wide — it is a field of `RK4Integrator` and nothing else.
    Every other container escapes into signatures (`Data` into 311 across 98
    files), and a provider type must match along the whole call chain —
    `Dims[nq=NV]` and `ModelDims[MD]` are DIFFERENT TYPES even when every
    value agrees — so converting those forces the signature sweep with them.
    §10.4 lists 1c and 2a as separate phases; the type system disagrees.
