"""`<rangefinder>` — distance from a site along its own +Z, or -1 for no hit.

`engine_sensor.c:601`. For a SITE-attached rangefinder the whole sensor is four
lines of the reference:

    rvec   = site_xmat column 2          (the site's own +Z, in world)
    origin = site_xpos
    dist   = mj_ray(m, d, origin, rvec, NULL, 1, site_bodyid, &geomid, NULL)

⚠⚠ THE RAY POINTS ALONG +Z, NOT -Z. A CAMERA looks down its own -Z
(`mjCCamera`) and a rangefinder fires along its +Z; the two conventions sit
three hundred lines apart in the same reference and are opposite. Getting it
backwards gives a sensor that reads the scenery BEHIND the robot, which on a
symmetric arena is a plausible-looking signal that never converges.

⚠ `bodyexclude` IS THE SITE'S BODY AND NOTHING MORE. A rangefinder on a
quadruped's torso excludes the torso and still sees its own legs — MuJoCo's
behaviour, reproduced rather than improved, and it is why `escape`'s readings
are not simply "distance to terrain".

⚠ STATICS ARE INCLUDED (`flg_static = 1`) and no group is filtered
(`geomgroup = NULL`), so the floor and the terrain both occlude. The only
exclusions left are the sensor's own body and INVISIBILITY — see
`ray/model.mojo`, where the latter is a precomputed flag precisely because it
is the difference between a rangefinder reading terrain and reading a
decoration.

⚠ **NO HIT IS -1, NOT INFINITY, NOT THE CUTOFF** — and -1 is a SENTINEL, not
a distance. ⚠⚠ AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS NOTE SAID `tanh(-1)` MAKES IT A
NEGATIVE READING. THAT IS WRONG. dm_control's `Physics.rangefinder`
(`quadruped.py:204`) reads

    np.where(rf_readings == -1.0, 1.0, np.tanh(rf_readings))

so a miss is replaced by **1.0** — the same value a very distant hit
saturates to — BEFORE the `tanh` is applied to the rest. There is no divide by
a scale either. The consequence for a consumer is the opposite of what that
note claimed: a miss reads as MAXIMUM range, and it is the caller's job to
apply that substitution, not this function's. Returning -1 here is what makes
the substitution possible; returning a large number would make it impossible.

COST. `ray_model` is a linear scan over every geom, so N rangefinders on a
model of G geoms cost N*G ray/geom queries per step — and any geom that is a
MESH costs its whole triangle soup on top. ⚠ An earlier form hoisted the geom
world poses into a `List` shared by all N sensors; `ray_model` composes them
inline now, because a GPU thread owns one RAY and cannot hold a scene.

⚠ `mut d` / `mut m` AND THE `mut` ON `Env.get_state` ARE THE SAME REQUIREMENT.
`TensorImpl.lt_dyn` needs a mutable container to hand out a `LayoutTensor`,
Mojo forbids caching one in a struct field (`AnyOrigin`), and there is no
non-mutating constructor. Nothing here writes; see `core/env.mojo` on why the
trait carries the marker anyway.
