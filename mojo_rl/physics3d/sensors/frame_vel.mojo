"""Site-frame velocity sensors — MuJoCo `velocimeter` and `gyro`.

Both are thin wrappers over `mj_objectVelocity(m, d, mjOBJ_SITE, id, res, 1)`
(engine_support.c), which transports the body's spatial velocity to the site
point and rotates it into the site frame:

    mju_transformSpatial(res, d->cvel + 6*bodyid, 0,
                         d->site_xpos + 3*siteid,          <- to here
                         d->subtree_com + 3*body_rootid,   <- from here
                         d->site_xmat + 9*siteid)          <- into this frame

    mjSENS_VELOCIMETER -> res[3:6]   (linear)
    mjSENS_GYRO        -> res[0:3]   (angular)

Our `Data` carries the same content in a different parameterisation:
`xangvel[b]` is the body's world angular velocity, and `xvel[b]` is its world
linear velocity AT `xipos[b]` (the body CoM — see `_vel_body`, which propagates
`v = v_parent + w_parent x (xipos - xipos_parent)`). So the transport is a
single cross product and the rotation is one inverse quaternion rotation:

    v_site_world = xvel[b] + xangvel[b] x (site_xpos - xipos[b])
    velocimeter  = R_site^T v_site_world
    gyro         = R_site^T xangvel[b]

THE SITE FRAME is `xquat[body] * site_quat`, composed by
`kinematics/site_frame.site_world_quat_list`. `Data` deliberately stores no
`site_xmat` — it is one quaternion multiply and every consumer already holds
the body quaternion, so materialising a `[BATCH, NSITE*9]` tensor and writing
it in four forward-kinematics paths would buy nothing the dynamics reads. See
that module for the reasoning.

⚠ This USED TO substitute the body's quaternion for the site's, which is exact
only for an identity-oriented site. Every model that reached here was of that
form, so the substitution was invisible; manipulator's rotated box touch zones
are what forced the site quaternion into the model record, and this was fixed
with it. Fixing it moved NO existing gate, which is the evidence that the old
scope really was as narrow as it claimed.

Used by dm_control's swimmer, whose `body_velocities()` observation is the
`[vx, vy, wz]` slice of one velocimeter/gyro pair per link.

    Extracted for dog `fetch`, which needs the same transport in WORLD frame
