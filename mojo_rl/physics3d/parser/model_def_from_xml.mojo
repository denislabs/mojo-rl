"""ModelDefFromXML — ModelDefLike implementation from an embedded MJCF XML string.

Enables zero-boilerplate physics environments from XML:

    var env = Phyics3dEnv[XmlModel, MyConfig]()

CPU path:  parse_xml_full() → FlatModelDef.setup_model() + FK + invweight0.
GPU path:  CPU Model → HostBuffer → DeviceBuffer → _compute_invweight0_gpu().
GPU kernels: comptimefor loops over comptime scalar helpers.
Rendering: no-op stubs (XML models have no visual configuration yet).

Note: Mojo nightly requires struct parameters to be accessed as 'Self.param'
inside the struct body. All dimension parameters follow this convention.

        nv:            Total velocity DOF.
        ngeom:         Total geometry count.
        nact:          Total actuator count.
        ntex:          Texture count from <asset> (default 0).
        nmat:          Material count from <asset> (default 0).
        nlight:        Light count in <worldbody> (default 0).
        ncam:          Camera count in <worldbody> (default 0).
        max_contacts:  Maximum contacts per step (default 50).
        max_equality:  Maximum equality constraints (default 0).
        cone_type:     Friction cone type (default PYRAMIDAL).
        max_tendon:    Maximum fixed tendons (default 0).
        nsite:   Total site count (default 0).
        neq:           Number of equality constraints (default 0).
        nexclude:      Number of contact exclusion pairs (default 0).
        npair:         Number of `<contact><pair>` records (default 0). This is
            the ONLY knob — it both counts and sizes the slab. Contrast
            `neq`/`max_equality`, where passing the count alone leaves storage
            at zero and the constraint silently vanishes.
        obs_qpos_skip: Leading qpos DOF to exclude from obs (default 1).
        obs_dim_override: Override OBS_DIM (default -1 = compute from nq-skip+nv).
            Use when custom_extract_obs_gpu produces different dimensionality than
            the default formula (e.g. InvertedDoublePendulum needs OBS_DIM=9 with
            sin/cos transforms despite nq-skip+nv=6).
        action_dim_override: Override ACTION_DIM (default -1 = use nact).
        timestep:      Simulation timestep (default 0.01).
        allow_unsupported_actuators: Build the model even when the XML declares
            <position>/<velocity>/<general> actuators. Those are servos the
            engine cannot simulate (no gainprm/biasprm — see gap G3 in
            docs/DM_CONTROL_PORT.md), so `init_fields` rejects them by default.
            Set True ONLY when the env's CONFIG bypasses `apply_actions`
            entirely (returns True from `custom_apply_actions_cpu`) and drives
            those DOFs itself — SawyerReach does exactly this for its two
            kp=400 gripper servos.
        max_condim:    Largest condim over the model's geoms; pass
                       `parse_xml(xml).MAX_CONDIM`. Over-estimating only
                       costs unused rows, under-estimating is silent.
        noslip_iter:   `<option noslip_iterations>`; pass
                       `parse_xml(xml).NOSLIP_ITER`. 0 disables the pass,
                       which is MuJoCo's default and correct for every suite
                       model except dog.
        allow_missing_noslip: DEPRECATED, and a no-op since 2026-08-13. It used
            to be the opt-in for `noslip_iter > 0` on an ELLIPTIC-cone model,
            back when `mj_solNoSlip` existed for the pyramidal cone only and
            the elliptic path skipped the pass in silence. Both branches are
            implemented now (`solver/noslip.mojo`) and the solver dispatches on
            the cone, so there is nothing to permit. Kept as an accepted
            parameter so existing model defs still compile; new code must not
            pass it.

        ⚠⚠ THIS USED TO BE `qfrc[dof] = gear * ctrl` OVER A SINGLE DOF, and
        that was blocker G. It read `motor_dof_adr` — one dof per actuator —
        where the CPU path walks the TRANSMISSION TRIPLES
        (`motor_trn_n/qadr/dadr/coef`, up to MAX_COMPTIME_TENDON_WRAPS of
        them). For a plain joint transmission the two agree exactly, which is
        why every Gym env was fine and nobody noticed. For a FIXED-TENDON
        transmission — point_mass, fish, manipulator, stacker, quadruped — the
        old form applied the whole force to one dof with coefficient 1 instead
        of distributing `gear * coef_k * force` across the tendon's dofs.

        Measured on point_mass before the fix, CPU vs GPU over 12 steps:
            action = 0.0   worst |qvel diff| = 0.0     (bit-identical)
            action = 0.8   worst |qvel diff| = 0.043
        i.e. the integrator was exact and the transmission was not.

        It also ASSIGNED rather than accumulating, and never zeroed the dofs no
        actuator drives — so a tendon transmission and a tendon spring landing
        on the same dof (fish's `fins_flap` + `fins_sym`) could not both apply.

        ACTIVATION (`d->act`) landed with blocker E3: `Phyics3dBatchedEnv`
        owns a `[N_ENVS, NA_F]` activation slab, and the mjDYN_FILTER
        integration at the end of the actuator loop below advances it.

        """Draw plane geoms (body_id=0): the ground as a grid, walls as slabs.

        ⚠ NOT EVERY PLANE IS A FLOOR. This used to send every plane geom to
        `draw_ground_grid` at its own `pos_z`, dropping its x/y position and
        its orientation entirely — so manipulator's four planes (floor at z=0,
        two 45° walls at z=.283, and a `background` at z=.5) came out as four
        stacked horizontal grids, the topmost ABOVE the arm's base. Read as a
        picture that is the arm hanging under a ceiling, which is exactly how
        it was reported: "things are below the ground".

        A plane is treated as the ground when it is UNROTATED; anything tilted
        or vertical is drawn as a thin oriented box of its declared
        half-extents. The ground keeps the grid path because that is what
        carries the infinite extent, the texture repeat and the reflection
        pass — a slab cannot stand in for it.

        ⚠ ORIENTATION DECIDES, POSITION MUST NOT. This test also required the
        plane to sit at x=y=0, and that was a REGRESSION (introduced with the
        oriented-plane fix, `8f248290`): the running tracks of cheetah
        (`pos="98 0 0"`), hopper (`pos="48 0 0"`) and walker (`pos="248 0 0"`)
        are unrotated floors that are merely OFFSET, so they fell to the slab
        path and rendered as flat white rectangles — `draw_box` takes a single
        colour and cannot carry the `grid` material's texture. The position
        test bought nothing even for the case it was added for: every wall and
        backdrop in manipulator, stacker, point_mass and reacher is rotated, so
        `upright` alone already excludes all of them. Verified by enumerating
        every plane geom in the suite — exactly those three change class.

        ⚠ This is the RENDER half of a defect whose PHYSICS half is still open:
        the plane narrow phase also assumes every plane is a horizontal floor
        at its origin's z with normal (0,0,1). Fixing the picture does not make
        an inclined plane collide correctly.

All seventeen render hooks above are pure functions of `rf: RenderFields`:
none of them reads a `Self.` member any more (the counts became
`len(rf.…)`, the source text became `rf.xml_text`/`rf.asset_base_dir`, and
the two helpers that were members are now module-level). So which
instantiation you call them ON does not matter, and this one — a model with
no bodies, no geoms and no XML — exists so the studio can call them with no
model type at all.

⚠⚠ THE PURITY IS A PROPERTY, NOT A GUARANTEE, AND IT IS LINTED. Reintroduce
one `Self.NGEOM` into a hook and this alias silently draws ZERO geoms for
every runtime-loaded model — the exact "two model paths" failure §10 of
`docs/PHYSICS3D_STUDIO_PLAN.md` names as the top risk, and one that no
compile catches. `scripts/audit_render_hooks_are_rf_pure.py` fails the moment
a hook body mentions `Self.`; run it in CI, not by hand.

⚠ WHY AN ALIAS AND NOT A SEPARATE `RuntimeModelDef` STRUCT. A second struct
would be a second copy of ~900 lines of hook, which is the same risk with
worse odds. There is exactly one implementation, and this names it.

The physics side needs nothing equivalent: `Model[DTYPE, DynDims]` and the
integrators already take their dimensions as a runtime value.
