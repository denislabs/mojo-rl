"""Actuator forces whose transmission depends on the POSE, not just `qpos`.

`apply_actions_fields` walks a transmission stored as `(qadr, dadr, coef)`
triples: an actuator's length is `gear * sum_k coef_k * qpos[qadr_k]` and its
moment is `gear * coef_k` on dof `dadr_k`. That covers a `joint=` transmission
(one triple, coef 1) and a `tendon=` transmission naming a **FIXED** tendon
(one triple per (joint, coef) pair). Both are functions of `qpos` alone, which
is why they can be evaluated before forward kinematics has run.

A **SPATIAL** tendon is not. Its length is the length of a polyline through
sites — possibly wrapping geoms — and its moment arm is
`d(length)/dq`, a dense `nv` vector that changes with the pose. MuJoCo gets
both from `mj_tendon`, which runs inside `mj_fwdPosition`, and reads them back
in `mj_fwdActuation` as `ten_length[id]` and `ten_moment[id]`.

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. `_fill_actuator_transmission` resolves a `tendon=`
actuator by copying the tendon's `(joint, coef)` list — the FIXED
representation. A spatial tendon has no such list, so the actuator came out
with `trn_n = 0`: it kept its slot in `nact`, consumed its control, and
applied **zero force**. `tetheria_aero_hand_open` drives six of its seven
actuators that way (`<position tendon="if_tendon0" kp="10000"/>` and five
more), so the hand had no tendons pulling it at all — it was the worst scene
in the Menagerie sweep at 2.590e-01.

The same is true of a spatial tendon SPRING (`<spatial stiffness=...>`), whose
deadband force needs the same length and the same moment arm.
`tetheria`'s eight springs are at their rest length at `qpos0` — which is why
the step-1 sweep saw only the actuators — and stretch as soon as it moves.

⚠⚠ THE CALLER'S OBLIGATION IS FRESH KINEMATICS, AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS A
SEPARATE FUNCTION. `apply_actions_fields` runs BEFORE the integrator's
`forward_kinematics`, so `d.xpos` / `d.xquat` / `d.subtree_com` describe the
pose one substep back and `sc.cdof` has not been rebuilt at all. For a joint
transmission that does not matter — it reads `qpos` directly. For this one it
is the difference between a moment arm and a stale moment arm, so this
function refreshes FK, the subtree CoM and `cdof` itself before reading them.
Running them again costs three passes on the models that need it and nothing
on the models that do not (the scan below exits before any of it).

⚠ IT ACCUMULATES, AND IT MUST RUN AFTER `apply_actions_fields`. That function
ZEROES `d.qfrc` and `d.dof_actdamp` before its own loop; this one adds to
both.

⚠ ONE ORDERING DIFFERENCE, DELIBERATELY LEFT. `apply_actions_fields` applies
MuJoCo's per-joint `jnt_actfrcrange` clamp at the end of its actuator loop,
i.e. BEFORE these forces are added. MuJoCo clamps the total once. The two
disagree only for a joint that is BOTH `actfrclimited` AND driven by a
pose transmission, where our answer is `clamp(a) + b` against MuJoCo's
`clamp(a + b)`. No model in this tree is: `jnt_actfrclimited` is 0 on all
three models with a pose transmission (tetheria, skydio_x2,
bitcraze_crazyflie_2). Re-clamping here would be wrong in the other
direction — it would clamp the tendon SPRING, which is `qfrc_passive` and
which MuJoCo never clamps.

⚠⚠ ONE PER CONTROL SUBSTEP, WHICH IS EXACT UNDER EULER AND NOT UNDER RK4.
The caller computes these forces once and then integrates; `mj_Euler`
evaluates the derivative once too, so the two agree exactly. `mj_RungeKutta`
evaluates it FOUR TIMES, at four different poses, and recomputes the
transmission at each — while ours stays frozen at the stage-0 moment. The
error is the rotation of the site (or the stretch of the tendon) across one
step, so it is small but real:

    bitcraze_crazyflie_2, one step from qpos0, worst |d(qpos)| vs MuJoCo
        with the integrator the file asks for      3.314e-13

⚠⚠ AND THAT NUMBER USED TO READ 9.200e-06, WHICH WAS A DIFFERENT DEFECT
ENTIRELY. This header claimed crazyflie's whole board residual for the frozen
transmission. It was not: `studio/stepping.mojo` selected between Euler and
implicitfast with a BOOLEAN, so `<option integrator="RK4">` fell out of the
`else` and the scene was driven with EULER — worth 9.200e-06 on its own, four
orders above anything this file does. The tell was in the numbers all along:
ours was EXACTLY 2x the reference in every dof, which is `a*dt^2` against
`a*dt^2/2`, an integrator ratio and not a moment-arm drift. Stepping RK4 (and
nothing else) takes the scene to the 3.314e-13 above.

What is left there IS this file: at 3.314e-13 the z and quaternion dofs are
bit-identical to MuJoCo and only x/y differ, ours coming out ~1.5e6 times too
SMALL — exactly what a thrust frozen along the stage-0 site axis does, since
a body that never tilts acquires no horizontal component. A pose-INDEPENDENT
transmission does not care: a `<motor joint=>` has the same force at all four
stages. Fixing it still means evaluating actuation inside the RK4 stage loop,
i.e. giving the integrator `sf` and the controls — the refactor this file was
written to avoid, now correctly priced at 3.3e-13 rather than 9.2e-06.

⚠ CPU ONLY, AND THE GPU PATH IS NOT SILENTLY WRONG. `actions` is a host
`List`, so there is nothing to launch; `apply_actions_kernel_gpu` keeps the
`(qadr, dadr, coef)` walk and therefore keeps giving a spatial-tendon
actuator zero force. The parser prints a count at model build for exactly
this reason. No batched env in this tree drives a spatial tendon.

`site=` and `body=` transmissions (`mjTRN_SITE`, `mjTRN_BODY`) belong here
too and are NOT implemented yet — both Menagerie quadrotors drive every
rotor through `<motor site="thrust1" gear="0 0 1 0 0 -.0201"/>`. The
kinematics this file refreshes are exactly what `mj_jacSite` needs, so that
is an addition to the loop below rather than another ordering problem.
