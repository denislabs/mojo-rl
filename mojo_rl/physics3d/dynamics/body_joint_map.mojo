"""Body → joint map, derived from the joint table once per call.

The body table has no `body_jntadr` / `body_jntnum` (MuJoCo's), so every
routine that wanted "the joints on body `b`" scanned all `njoint` rows per
body — O(nbody · njoint) reads of `JOINT_IDX_BODY_ID` with a float→int
conversion each: three such scans a step on dog (RNE, and twice in the
post-constraint RNE), 62 bodies × 50 joints. Joints are stored in body
order, so a body's joints are contiguous, and this map is one O(njoint)
pass. If they ever were not contiguous the map is rejected (`False`) and
the caller keeps its scanning form, so a model the assumption does not hold
for is slower, not wrong. First written inline in the Newton for the
contact rows (PERFORMANCE.md §13.25), shared from §13.26 on.
