"""`d.ten_length` — MuJoCo's `mj_tendon`, run only when something reads it.

⚠ ITS SIBLING `d.actuator_length` IS NOT FILLED HERE, and the asymmetry is
forced. The actuator records live in `SpecFields`, which `EulerIntegrator`
does not hold — `step` is handed `Data` and `Model` only. The transmission
length is therefore written by `apply_actions_fields`, which owns those
records, already walks each actuator's triples, and runs at the same `qpos`
MuJoCo's `mj_transmission` does. See `Data.actuator_length`.

MuJoCo fills `d->ten_length` for every tendon inside every `mj_fwdPosition`.
This engine does not, and that is a deliberate scope call rather than a gap:
a spatial tendon's length is a polyline walk over its wrap geoms, and the
three places that need one — `constraints/tendon_limit`,
`constraints/equality_tendon`, `dynamics/pose_transmission` — each compute it
for the tendons THEY care about, at the point they care. Materialising the
whole array every step would add a second walk per tendon per step (700 of
them on `ms_human_700`) to serve a sensor almost nothing declares.

⚠⚠ SO THIS PASS IS GUARDED ON A CONSUMER, AND THE GUARD IS THE SENSOR TABLE.
`compute_tendon_lengths` returns immediately unless some SERVED sensor row is
a `<tendonpos>`. Everything else leaves `d.ten_length` at the NaN `Data`
filled it with — loud to a reader, free to a model that never asks. A zero
fill would have been a plausible length.

⚠ `flg_jac=False` ON THE SPATIAL CALL, WHICH IS WHY `cdof` MAY BE STALE HERE.
The length is `sum |p_{k+1} - p_k|` over world points and reaches `cdof` only
through `_contact_jacobian_row`, which that flag skips. This pass runs at
MuJoCo's `mj_tendon` point — inside the position stage, before the sensors
that read it — and the step builds `cdof` later. See
`spatial_tendon_length_jac`'s own note.

⚠ CPU, ANY BATCH. The pass was BATCH=1 when the sensor landed, which left
`<tendonpos>` marked SERVED in the table and NaN in the slot on any batched
model — the single failure the `served` flag exists to exclude. It is an env
loop over a per-env body now, the shape `sensors/eval.mojo` uses.

⚠ NO DEVICE LEG, AND THE OBSTACLE IS NAMED. `spatial_tendon_length_jac`
builds two `Scratch` arrays of `nv` (`J_row`, `seg_J`) and zeroes the first
unconditionally, so a kernel thread would carry `2*nv` floats of per-thread
stack for a Jacobian this caller passes `flg_jac=False` to discard. Making
that free wants a comptime `FLG_JAC` parameter on the helper — guarding the
declarations, not just the writes — which is a change to eight call sites
including the solver's. Until then a GPU-batched `<tendonpos>` reads NaN, and
`test_tendon_length_batched_vs_mujoco` pins which leg serves it.
