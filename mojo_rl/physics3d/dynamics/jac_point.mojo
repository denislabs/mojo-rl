"""`mj_jac` / `mj_jacSite` — the full 3-by-nv translational and rotational
Jacobians of a world point attached to a body.

WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE CONSTRAINT ROWS. The same arithmetic is
already in the tree twice, but both copies project onto a direction and return
a SCALAR row: `constraints/contact_solve._contact_jacobian_row` (translation,
dotted with the contact normal) and `_angular_jacobian_row` (rotation, dotted
with a torsion axis). Inverse kinematics needs the UNPROJECTED 6 x nv, because
the damped-least-squares update solves against the whole matrix rather than one
direction of it. This module is that same arithmetic with the dot product
removed — not a re-derivation.

TRANSCRIBED FROM `engine_core_util.c:mj_jac`. That function is BYTE-IDENTICAL
in the 3.6.0 and 3.11.0 reference trees, and the runtime here is 3.10.0, so the
usual version-drift caveat (`references/` never matches the runtime) does not
bite for once.

Two details differ from the contact-row copies. Only the second changes a
number; the first is recorded so nobody "fixes" it back:

1. THE OFFSET IS HOISTED. MuJoCo computes
   `offset = point - subtree_com[body_rootid[body]]` ONCE before the loop;
   `_contact_jacobian_row` recomputes it inside the loop from each joint's
   body's rootid. ⚠ THESE ARE THE SAME VALUE, ALWAYS — `body_rootid` is by
   construction the child-of-world on a body's chain, so every ancestor of the
   target shares the target's root, and only ancestors are ever visited. This
   was checked rather than assumed: over all of quadruped's bodies, the number
   of ancestors carrying a different rootid is 0. Hoisting is MuJoCo's
   formulation and one fewer lookup per DOF, not a correctness fix.

2. ⚠ THE BODY IS REMAPPED THROUGH `body_weldid` AND MAY TERMINATE THE WHOLE
   THING. A body with no joints of its own is welded to its nearest jointed
   ancestor; if that resolves to the world, MuJoCo returns a ZERO Jacobian
   rather than walking anything. A site on a static decoration is not an
   error, it is a site that cannot be moved. quadruped fetch has exactly one
   such site, so the branch is exercised — though ⚠ NOT DISCRIMINATINGLY:
   deleting the early return gives zero anyway, because the ancestor walk then
   finds no joints. It is transcription faithfulness, not a guard whose
   removal a test would catch.

LAYOUT. MuJoCo writes `jacp[i + k*nv]` — row-major 3 x nv, row `k` is the world
axis and column `i` the DOF. `jacp[k * nv + i]` here, same thing. ⚠ Reading it
as nv x 3 transposes silently and still has the right norm, so a gate that only
checks magnitudes will not see it.
