"""Fetch, verify, extract and materialise an asset pack.

    pull_pack(pack, into_dir)     # idempotent; no bytes move if already there

## The three stages, and why they are separate

    1. FETCH     <cache>/assets/<sha256>.archive     verified against sha256
    2. EXTRACT   <cache>/assets/<sha256>/            once, marked by .ok
    3. LINK      <dest>/                             hard link, else copy

⚠⚠ THE CACHE IS KEYED BY THE ARCHIVE'S SHA256, NOT BY THE PACK NAME. Two envs
declaring the same bytes share one download; a pack that is re-cut under the
same version gets a different key and cannot be silently served from a stale
cache. A name-keyed cache has the opposite property on both counts.

⚠ HARD LINK, FALLING BACK TO COPY, NEVER SYMLINK — the same rule as policy
promotion, for the same reasons: a symlink into a cache breaks under rsync,
breaks when the cache is cleared, and turns into a dead pointer that looks like
a missing file much later.

## ⚠⚠ The credential is chosen by the PROVIDER, and never by the URL

`resolve_url` is the whole point of this module. A private pack is not "a URL
with a token bolted on": for `monitor` the API key goes to OUR Worker, which
answers with a presigned URL, and the transfer itself carries no credential at
all. That is why the provider has to be declared rather than inferred — two
`https://` URLs can need different secrets, or none.
