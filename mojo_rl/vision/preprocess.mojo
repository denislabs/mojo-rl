"""Camera frame -> the exact tensor ACT was trained on.

⚠⚠ **THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE NO OpenCV RESIZE MATCHES THE TRAINING PIPELINE.**
`tools/act/lerobot_v3_to_store.py` downscales every 640x480 frame to 320x240
with **PIL BILINEAR**, and PIL scales its filter support with the reduction
factor — so at 2x it is a 4-tap triangle, not the 2-tap of `INTER_LINEAR` nor
the 2x2 box of `INTER_AREA`. Measured on five real frames from the 50-demo
dataset, against PIL:

    INTER_AREA      mean |d| 1.195   max 33   12.9% of pixels off by >2
    INTER_LINEAR    mean |d| 1.217   max 34   13.1%
    INTER_CUBIC     mean |d| 2.206   max 61   19.5%
    INTER_LANCZOS4  mean |d| 2.376   max 64   20.6%

~1.2/255 in the mean is small. It is also an AVOIDABLE train/deploy gap in a
project that keeps being bitten by silent representation differences, and the
alternative — re-converting the dataset with a different filter — costs a
retrain. So PIL's algorithm is reproduced here bit for bit instead, and the
gate asserts EXACT equality rather than a tolerance.

WHAT "PIL'S ALGORITHM" MEANS, PRECISELY (libImaging/Resample.c):

  * `support = 1.0 * max(scale, 1)`, `ksize = ceil(support) * 2 + 1` — the
    window GROWS when downscaling, which is the whole difference.
  * coefficients in double, normalised to sum 1, then converted to INT32 fixed
    point with 22 fractional bits.
  * the accumulator starts at `1 << 21` (round-to-nearest), sums
    `uint8 * int32`, then `>> 22` and clamps to 0..255.
  * ⚠ TWO PASSES WITH AN **8-BIT INTERMEDIATE**: horizontal into a temporary
    image, then vertical over that. Keeping the intermediate in higher
    precision is more accurate and produces DIFFERENT numbers, which is the
    wrong goal here — matching is.
