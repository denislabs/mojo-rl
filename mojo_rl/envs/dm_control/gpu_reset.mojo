"""GPU-side reset randomizers for the dm_control suite.

⚠ COMPILED AND GATED as of 2026-08-06, via cartpole (`standard_normal`) and
cheetah/walker (`randomize_limited_and_rotational_joints_gpu`). It did NOT
compile the first time it was instantiated — a generic body is not type-checked
until something binds its parameters, and `import` is not a compile gate
(`feedback_ungated_generic_is_uncompiled_code`). Two errors surfaced then:
naming `PhiloxRandom` as a RETURN TYPE, and the `log`/`cos`
`is_floating_point()` evidence. Both shaped the API below — keep generator
types OUT of signatures. Anything added here is a DRAFT until a config
instantiates it.

Port of `dm_control/suite/utils/randomizers.py` for the batched GPU path.
The CPU counterpart is open-coded in each config's `custom_reset_cpu` (it can
reach `std.random.random_float64()` and iterate `m_joints` as a `List`); a
kernel can do neither, so the shared form lives here.

Called from `Phyics3dEnvConfig.init_qpos_gpu`, which since 2026-08-06 receives
the `joints` model tensor and a `seed` for exactly this (G10 step 4 — see
docs/DM_CONTROL_GPU_TRAINING_G10.md §6).

⚠ WHAT "LIMITED" MEANS HERE. The reference asks MuJoCo for `jnt_limited`; we
have no such column, so — exactly as every `custom_reset_cpu` in the suite
does, and as `constraints/limits.mojo` does when it decides whether to emit a
limit row — a range beyond +-1e9 is read as UNLIMITED. Keeping the two paths on
the same rule is what makes the CPU gate meaningful for the GPU path.

FREE JOINTS: covered as of 2026-08-06, when humanoid needed it (`RANDOMIZE_FREE_QUAT`).
The three LINEAR dofs are left alone and qpos[adr+3 .. adr+6] gets a random
quaternion. ⚠ ONE REFERENCE QUIRK IS REPRODUCED DELIBERATELY, exactly as the
CPU hook does: `randomizers.py` says "sampled uniformly on the unit 3-sphere",
but its free-joint branch calls `random.rand(4)` — uniform on [0,1)^4, NOT
`randn(4)` as the ball branch two lines up does. So every component is
non-negative and the orientations sit in one orthant, nowhere near uniform on
SO(3). We match the CODE, not the docstring: an agent trained against
dm_control sees this distribution.

⚠ STILL NOT COVERED: `mjJNT_BALL`. Nothing ported has one. Add it with the
first domain that does, and gate it — an ungated branch here is uncompiled
code (`feedback_ungated_generic_is_uncompiled_code`), which this module has
already been bitten by once.

    `RANDOMIZE_FREE_QUAT=True` additionally randomizes a free root's
    orientation (humanoid, humanoid_cmu); it is off by default because a

    else), so passing True there would randomize its three unlimited root dofs
    and change the initial state distribution.
