"""`dm_control` `point_mass-hard` task config — port of `suite/point_mass.py`.

Identical to `easy` in observation, reward, episode length and model. The ONE
difference is `initialize_episode`, which additionally randomizes the mapping
from controls to joints (`PointMass.__init__(randomize_gains=True)`):

    dir1 = random.randn(2); dir1 /= norm(dir1)
    parallel = True
    while parallel:                       # reject a near-parallel second axis
      dir2 = random.randn(2); dir2 /= norm(dir2)
      parallel = abs(dot(dir1, dir2)) > 0.9
    physics.model.wrap_prm[[0, 1]] = dir1
    physics.model.wrap_prm[[2, 3]] = dir2

so each control drives a random linear combination of `root_x`/`root_y`, and
the policy has to infer the mixing from experience. `easy`'s identity mixing is
the special case.

WHERE THE COEFS LIVE. `wrap_prm` for a fixed tendon is the per-joint `coef` of
each `<joint>` wrap, in declaration order: entries 0,1 are `t1`'s coefs on
(root_x, root_y) and 2,3 are `t2`'s. Here that is
`Model.tendons[t, TENDON_IDX_COEF_0/1]` — the RUNTIME records, written by
`custom_reset_model_cpu` below.

WHY THIS CONFIG ALSO OWNS ACTUATION. `MODEL_DEF.apply_actions` reads its
transmission from the COMPTIME tables (`_acd.motor_trn_coef`), baked from the
XML at build time and therefore blind to per-episode writes. Inheriting it
would silently keep the identity mixing and turn `hard` back into `easy` — a
task that trains perfectly well and is simply the wrong one. So the config
returns True from `custom_apply_actions_cpu` and redoes the (short) motor
transmission against the runtime records instead.

Everything else is `easy`'s, reused rather than restated: the joint randomizer,
the sparse-ish `tolerance` reward and the timestep all come from
`DMPointMassConfig`.

        The same arithmetic as `custom_apply_actions_cpu`, and for the same
        reason: `MODEL_DEF.apply_actions_kernel_gpu` reads its transmission
        from the COMPTIME tables, baked from the XML and therefore blind to
        the per-episode mixing. Inheriting it would silently keep the identity
        coefficients and turn `hard` back into `easy` — a task that trains
        perfectly well and is simply the wrong one.

        Only the COEFS come from `meta`; the joint ids and the wrap count
        still come from the RUNTIME tendon records, and gear/ctrlrange from
        the comptime tables (`hard` randomizes the mixing only, so those are
        as constant as the XML).

        ACTUATOR a DRIVES TENDON a — the model declares one `<motor tendon=>`
        per `<fixed>`, in the same order, and nothing at runtime records that
        pairing. The parity test pins it.
