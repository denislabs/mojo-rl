"""One reach-task config, shared by SO-ARM100 and SO-ARM101.

`docs/SO_ARM101_PORT_ASSESSMENT.md` §1 concludes "one env, two model files".
This file is what makes that structural rather than aspirational: both arms
have the same topology (nbody 8 / njnt 6 / nq 6 / nu 6) and — measured — the
same body indices for the end-effector (7) and the appended target (8), so a
single `Phyics3dEnvConfig` parameterised by four numbers serves both.

    observation = [qpos(6), qvel(6), ee_xyz(3), target_xyz(3), ee_to_target(3)]
    action      = 6 joint POSITION TARGETS, in RADIANS
    reward      = tolerance(||ee - target||, (0, TARGET_RADIUS), margin)
    episode     = MAX_STEPS control steps, no early termination

⚠⚠ THE ACTION SPACE IS RADIANS, NOT [-1, 1]. Both models drive `<position>`
servos whose `ctrlrange` is the joint's own range, so `action_low_at(i)` /
`action_high_at(i)` differ per actuator (`Pitch` is [-3.32, 0.174]). A policy
emitting tanh-bounded actions MUST be rescaled by the caller. This is the exact
shape of the defect `c1ebf61e` fixed — an env that advertised one scalar pair
for six differently-ranged actuators — so it is stated here rather than left to
be discovered. `apply_actions` clamps to the per-actuator range, so a policy
that ignores this is silently squashed onto the first radian of travel.

⚠ THE TARGET IS SAMPLED IN THE ARM'S OWN AZIMUTH CONE. `AZ_CENTER` differs
between the two models because their base frames do — SO-100's arm extends
along -y at qpos 0, SO-101's along +x — and both `Rotation`/`shoulder_pan`
ranges are ±1.92 rad, not a full circle. Sampling a full circle would make a
third of every episode physically unreachable and read as "the policy plateaus".

GPU HOOKS LANDED 2026-08-25 — `HAS_GPU_HOOKS = True`, so the batched path
compiles and trains. They were written against
`dm_control/reacher/reacher_config.mojo`, the only other config in the tree
with GPU hooks AND a mocap target, and the note this paragraph replaces was
right that writing them blind is how `ungated_generic_is_uncompiled_code`
happens — so they are gated CPU-vs-GPU rather than merely compiled.

⚠ THE OBSERVATION ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. The batched trainer writes a
checkpoint the single-env eval loads, so `custom_extract_obs_cpu` and
`custom_extract_obs_gpu` must emit the same 21 values in the same order. A
permutation is a policy that works on one device and is nonsense on the other,
with no error anywhere — which is why the two are compared directly rather
than each being checked against a description.

⚠ RESET DOES NOT USE `<keyframe>`. Our parser ignores the section
(`docs/TODDLERBOT_PORT_PLAN.md` §4.6), so SO-100's `home` pose is baked into
`SO_ARM100_HOME` in `so_arm100_config.mojo` and written here by index. When
`<keyframe>` lands, this should read the parsed key and the baked copy should
be DELETED rather than kept alongside it.

    # ⚠ THE NEAR END IS WHERE THE POLICY FAILS, and it is a WORKSPACE fact,

    #
    #     r <  0.17 m   reached <=20 mm in  1 of  6 episodes   (17%)
    #     r >= 0.17 m   reached <=20 mm in 14 of 18 episodes   (78%)
    #
    # An FK sweep of 40 000 random poses inside the joint limits says why: the
    # jaw's reachable set thins out sharply toward the base. Poses landing in
    # the (radius, elevation) cell at r = 0.15 fall from 396 at low elevation
    # to 1 at el = 1.3, against 528..455 for the same elevations at r = 0.275.
    # A near target is reachable only through a narrow, tightly-folded band of
    # configurations — so it is not "hard to learn", it is nearly singular.
    #
    # R_MIN IS NOW 0.18, which drops that tail. ⚠ EVERY NUMBER MEASURED
    # AGAINST 0.15 IS NOW INCOMPARABLE, including the reach rates quoted

    # is a strictly easier target distribution, so a rate measured here must

    # onto a sparse reward.
    #
    # ⚠⚠ WAS 0.25 — TWELVE TIMES THE SUCCESS RADIUS — AND THAT WAS THE ROOT
    # DEFECT BEHIND EVERY SYMPTOM THIS TASK HAS SHOWN. At 0.25 the falloff is
    # nearly flat across the whole neighbourhood of the target, so:
    #
    #   * hovering 40 mm away scored 0.985/step, i.e. 492.7/500 for an arm
    #     that never touches the target;
    #   * closing the last 24 mm was worth 0.0006/step, against 0.20 for the
    #     stillness term — a 333x inversion of the task's own priorities;
    #   * ORBITING between 4 mm and 40 mm cost 0.015/step, so a policy that
    #     swings through the target and back out lost essentially nothing.
    #
    # That last one is not hypothetical: measured on hardware 2026-08-26, the
    # trained policy reached 3.9 mm and then orbited 8..43 mm for the rest of
    # the run, at 40% of steps inside the radius. Sim shows the same shape
    # (per-episode closest 4..9 mm, final 20..41 mm), so it transferred
    # faithfully — the behaviour is the REWARD's, not the hardware's.
    #
    # At 0.05 that same orbit costs 0.308/step, twenty times more and now the
    # dominant term. Resting on target finally beats passing through it.

    #    100 mm       0.790        0.003
    #
    # ⚠ THE ORIGINAL REASON FOR 0.25 WAS EXPLORATION and it was a good one —
    # at 0.05 a target 100 mm away is worth 0.003/step, so a policy that
    # cannot already find the target learns nothing. FINE-TUNE FROM AN
    # EXISTING CHECKPOINT rather than training from scratch: exploration is
    # demonstrably solved (the arm reaches 4 mm), and the tighter margin only
    # sharpens the endgame. From scratch, keep 0.25 until the arm reaches,
    # then tighten and continue.

    # ── the stillness term ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # ⚠⚠ WITHOUT THIS THE POLICY SHAKES, AND THE REWARD CANNOT SEE IT.
    # `tolerance`'s margin is 12x its success radius, so hovering 40 mm away
    # scores 0.985 and there is nothing left to distinguish a still arm from a
    # vibrating one. Measured on a trained checkpoint, over the 300 control
    # steps AFTER it has arrived: mean per-joint |qvel| **1.21 rad/s** (69
    # deg/s), peak **5.8 rad/s**, and the velocity REVERSES SIGN on 59% of
    # control steps. The commanded position moves ~500 servo ticks per joint
    # per step, reversing on 83%. On hardware that is continuous current
    # reversal through the gear train for the whole episode.
    #
    # ⚠ THE PENALTY IS ON `qvel`, NOT ON THE ACTION RATE, and the reason is
    # MARKOV rather than aesthetic: the previous action is NOT in the
    # observation, so an agent penalised for `a_t - a_{t-1}` is being charged
    # for a quantity it cannot observe, and can only learn a blurred average
    # of it. `qvel` IS in the observation (indices 6..11). Penalising the
    # action rate properly means widening the observation to carry the
    # previous action — a different and larger change, and the measurement
    # above says the joints really are moving, so this term has something
    # real to bite on. `deploy_reach_real.mojo`'s `SMOOTH` covers whatever
    # command chatter survives.
    #
    # ⚠ NOT ON THE ACTION MAGNITUDE EITHER — the gym `ctrl_cost` idiom is
    # actively WRONG here. These are `<position>` actuators, so an action IS a
    # joint angle: penalising its magnitude pulls the arm toward zero, which
    # is a POSE, not an effort.
    #
    # Shape is dm_control's, from `suite/humanoid.py`:
    #     small_control = (4 + small_control) / 5
    #     return small_control * stand_reward * move
    # i.e. a MULTIPLICATIVE term squashed into [FLOOR, 1]. Multiplicative
    # matters: the cost of moving scales with how well the arm is doing, so
    # travelling fast while still far away is nearly free and vibrating on
    # target is not — which is the distinction the task wants and a subtractive
    # penalty would flatten.
    #
    # Speed is the L2 norm over all DOF. `VEL_FREE` is the speed that costs
    # nothing; past it the quadratic sigmoid falls to zero at `VEL_FREE +
    # VEL_MARGIN`. Defaults put the measured shake (L2 ~3 rad/s) at the floor
    # and a still arm at 1.0.
    VEL_FREE: Float64 = 0.3,
    # ⚠⚠ 5.0, NOT 2.0, AND THIS IS WHY FOUR CHECKPOINTS SAT AT THE FLOOR.
    # `_still` used `SIGMOID_QUADRATIC` with value-at-margin 0, which has
    # COMPACT SUPPORT: exactly zero past `VEL_FREE + VEL_MARGIN` = 2.3 rad/s,
    # and exactly zero means ZERO DERIVATIVE. Measured on the trained policy:
    # L2 joint speed after arrival averages **2.483 rad/s** over a 0.96..4.42
    # range, so **69.5% of control steps sat in the flat region** and the term
    # said nothing at all about slowing down. Mean `calm` was 0.080.
    #
    # That is the same defect as the action clamp — a dead gradient band —
    # built by taking dm_control's `small_control` margin (1.0 on a [-1, 1]
    # control) without checking it against THIS arm's speed range.
