"""Config for the P0 scene-budget probe — deliberately the emptiest one here.

⚠⚠ THIS IS NOT A TASK AND MUST NEVER BECOME ONE. Reward is a constant 0 and
nothing ever terminates. That is not laziness, it is the measurement: P0 asks
what a PARKED SLOT costs the physics step, so every quantity that is not the
physics step is held at zero. A reward hook that read `xpos` would put a
per-body loop into the very kernel whose per-body cost is the thing being
measured, and the curve would then include it.

For the same reason there is no obs shaping: `custom_extract_obs_gpu` is left
at the trait default, so the model's default observation is used unchanged
across every k.

## The three legs this serves

`docs/TASK_LAYER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` §1. Leg 1 sweeps the slot count with
`max_contacts` PINNED (see `so101_park_xml.PARK_MAX_CONTACTS`); leg 2 sweeps
`max_contacts` alone at k=0; leg 3 is `REPARK` below.

## ⚠ REPARK — leg 3, and what it can and cannot do

`docs/TASK_LAYER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` Gap D: a parked free body does not STAY
parked. Gravity is a `Model` field, shared across lanes, so a slot written to
its park pose at reset then FALLS for the whole episode — `qvel` grows, and its
broadphase AABB moves every step, so SAP re-sorts it every step. "Parked" as
`docs/TASK_LAYER_PLAN.md` §3.3 specifies it is an initial condition, not an
invariant. `REPARK=True` makes it an invariant by rewriting the pose every
step, which is what would ship.

⚠⚠ AND IT PINS THE POSE ONLY — IT CANNOT ZERO THE VELOCITY. `pre_step_gpu`'s
ABI is `(qpos, meta, env)`: there is no `qvel` operand
(`phyics3d_env_config.mojo:641`, called at `phyics3d_batched_env.mojo:1381`).
So a reparked slot holds its position while `qvel` keeps accumulating downward
— harmless over a 300-step horizon (~11.8 m/s, and the position is pinned
regardless), but NOT what should ship. **Adding `qvel` to that hook is a P3
plumbing item**, and it is exactly the sort of thing that is invisible until
someone tries to use the hook for this. Leg 3's number is therefore a LOWER
BOUND on the repark cost and an UPPER BOUND on the saving.

⚠ The park pose comes from `so101_park_pose.mojo`, which the scene generator
emits. Do not spell it here — see that file's header for why.
