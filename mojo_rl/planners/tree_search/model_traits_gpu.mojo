"""GPU tree-search model contract — Representation / Dynamics / Prediction.

The GPU counterpart of ``model_traits.mojo``. Same three-trait split, but
the surface speaks ``LayoutTensor`` views with a method-level ``B: Int``
comptime parameter — exactly the shape ``Network[…].forward_gpu[B]``
expects. Adapters wrap a ``GPUNetworkState`` and call into ``Network``;
they don't need to know about the MCTS kernels.

These traits are scaffolding for the generic GPU MCTS orchestrator (the
``GenericGPUMCTS`` struct, landing later in Phase 3b together with the
agent rewiring). They are not consumed yet — the production GPU search
loop currently lives inline inside ``muzero.mojo:select_action_gpu`` and
calls the kernels in ``planners/tree_search/mcts_gpu.mojo`` directly,
interleaving its own ``Network.forward_gpu`` calls. Shipping the trait
surface now gives that rewiring a fixed target to bind to.

**Why this is just three forward methods** (no softmax / decode /
scaling): all of those live in the MCTS GPU kernels already
(``gpu_mcts_init_root_kernel`` softmaxes priors, the
``…_expand_backup_…`` family decodes categorical reward / value with the
inverse scalar transform, hidden MinMax scaling runs inline). The agent
adapter's only job is to feed network params + state and produce the raw
network output — same way the inline orchestrator does today.

The future ``GenericGPUMCTS`` struct (sketched in
``docs/PLANNERS_PACKAGE.md`` Phase 3b) will own the ``GPUMCTSState`` and
the search loop, taking ``REP: RepresentationGPU``, ``DYN: DynamicsGPU``,
``PRED: PredictionGPU`` as comptime params plus the existing strategy
traits (``PUCTFormula`` / ``ExplorationNoise`` / ``PlayerMode``).
