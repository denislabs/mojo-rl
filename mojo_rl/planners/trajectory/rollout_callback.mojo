"""RolloutCallback traits — per-step model contract for trajectory optimizers.

These traits are the Phase-2 generalization of ``ScorePlanCallback``
(which scored a whole plan in one call). MPPI / iLQR / future MPC need
finer access: each candidate trajectory is rolled out step-by-step, with
the optimizer choosing actions and the callback advancing latent state
and producing per-step rewards plus a terminal value bootstrap.

Two traits, not one, because the CPU and GPU worlds have genuinely
different interfaces:

* ``RolloutCallbackCPU`` operates on ``List[Float64]`` views. B = 1 per
  call — the planner loops over samples / timesteps. Used by
  ``MPPICPU`` and by isolated stub-model tests
  (``LinearQuadratic``, etc.) where a List interface keeps the test
  fixture trivial.

* ``RolloutCallbackGPU`` operates on row-major ``LayoutTensor`` views
  with a method-level ``B`` comptime parameter, matching the existing
  TDMPC2 kernel signatures. The planner batches all
  ``N_ENVS × TOTAL_SAMPLES`` trajectories into one call per
  per-horizon-step. Used by ``MPPIGPUBatched`` and TDMPC2 production.

A given implementor can satisfy one or both. ``LinearQuadratic`` stubs
implement only CPU; ``TDMPC2RolloutCallback`` implements only GPU (the
TDMPC2 agent never invokes the CPU planner on a real world model).
CPU↔GPU parity tests use a stub that implements both — these are the
only consumers that need both surfaces.

Three methods per trait — each maps to one of MPPI's three calls into
the world model:

1. ``policy_action`` — produce a deterministic policy mean at ``z``.
   Used by MPPI for the ``NUM_PI_TRAJS`` policy-seeded warm-start
   trajectories, and for the terminal action in ``terminal_value``.
   Stubs without a learned policy can return zero — pi-trajs degenerate
   to "mean-seeded with noise" trajectories, which is harmless.
2. ``rollout_step`` — advance one step: ``(z, a) → (z', r_scalar)``.
   This is the hot path; the callback is responsible for build_za +
   dynamics + reward + categorical decode (where applicable). Returns
   a scalar reward per batch row.
3. ``terminal_value`` — bootstrap value at the end of the horizon.
   Typically ``Q(z, π(z))`` averaged over a random Q-pair (TDMPC2) or
   the LQR closed-form value (LinearQuadratic). Returns a scalar
   per batch row. May read a random seed to support TDMPC2's
   per-MPPI-iter Q-pair resampling.

Performance contract (carried over from the design doc): a faithful
GPU implementor must not add device syncs or host-side round-trips
inside the trait methods — the planner is allowed to enqueue all
``HORIZON`` rollout steps without any intervening sync.
