"""Constants for nn2/.

DT is pinned to float32 at the framework scope; AMP overrides happen at
the per-call site via `POLICY: AMPPolicy` (see `core/amp.mojo`).

CPU_SIMD_W is the SIMD lane count for `DT` on the host CPU. Used by
hand-rolled SIMD elementwise paths (ReLU/Tanh/MSE/elementwise) since
Mojo nightly does not autovectorize scalar `ptr[i]` loops — manual
`while i + W <= N: ptr.load[width=W]` gives 3-5x over the scalar form.
See feedback_mojo_cpu_manual_simd_required.

TPB / TPB_REDUCE are the threads-per-block defaults for nn2 / deep_agents2
GPU launches. TPB (128) is used for elementwise 1-D launches over N or
N*BATCH; TPB_REDUCE (64) is used by per-batch reduction kernels (one block
per batch element) such as MSE/CE forward. These values were chosen during
the nn2 bit-identity baselines (SAC -169.04118, MBPO -143.13, PPO -230.15)
and changing them invalidates those baselines. If hardware-adaptive tuning
is ever needed, gate via `has_nvidia_gpu_accelerator()` at the call site.
Shape-derived block sizes (e.g. `TPB = max(OBS, ACT)` in gpu_replay) stay
local to their kernel.

# launches into one grouped launch per optimizer/critic-pair; when False, the

# per-tensor — Metal can't deref host-captured device addresses in-kernel).
