"""Seed gradient tile of shape [BATCH, 1] with 1/BATCH.

This is the standard "seed the backward pass for a mean-over-batch
loss" helper: when the forward output is `loss_per_b` of shape
[BATCH, 1] and the trainer wants `d(mean_b(loss_per_b))/d(loss_per_b)`,
that gradient is the constant `1/BATCH` in every slot.

Replaces the inline `_fill_constant_kernel` previously open-coded in
`sac_actor_loss.mojo`. Both CPU and GPU paths.

Phase 3 — Lives in `loss/` because mean-batch backward is the loss
contract. Other primitives that need a constant-fill should call this
helper rather than re-rolling.
