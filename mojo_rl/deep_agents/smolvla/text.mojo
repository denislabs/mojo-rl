# | SmolVLA — the SmolLM2 text tower's weights
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
"""The language half of SmolVLM2-500M, as shipped inside `lerobot/smolvla_base`.

    hidden 960 · 16 layers · 15 query heads over 5 KV heads (head_dim 64)
    SwiGLU ff 2560 · RMSNorm eps 1e-5 · rope_theta 100000 · vocab 49280

⚠ **16 layers, not 32.** The backbone's own `config.json` says
`num_hidden_layers = 32`; SmolVLA ships sixteen (`num_vlm_layers: 16`) and
truncates the tower to its first half. Depth comes from the checkpoint.

⚠ **The prefix pass is NOT causal.** `make_att_2d_masks` is prefix-LM and
SmolVLA sets `ar = 0` across BOTH the image and language spans, so the whole
visual+text prefix is one bidirectional block. See `attn_mask.mojo`.

## Weights, not a composed tower

This was first written as `Sequential[Repeat[16, layer], norm]`, which type-
checked and ran — and could not be used. The fused VLM+expert loop needs each
layer's K/V **between** the projection and the attention, to write into the
prefix cache, and a composed tower hands back only its final activation. So the
tower is a `DecoderLayerWeights` container, exactly like the expert, and the
loop that drives it lives in `fused.mojo`.

A VLM text layer IS an expert layer at different widths — same struct, five
different numbers — which is why both towers share `layer_weights.mojo` rather
than restating the topology twice.
