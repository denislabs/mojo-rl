"""What the model is actually trained on, which is not what it is run on.

Inference integrates a velocity field over ten Euler steps. Training does no
integration at all: it samples ONE time `t`, forms the point `x_t` on the
straight line between the action chunk and a noise sample, asks the network
for the velocity there, and compares it to the velocity the straight line
actually has.

    noise ~ N(0, 1)                         the flow-matching x_1
    t     ~ Beta(1.5, 1) * 0.999 + 0.001    openpi's convention
    x_t   = t*noise + (1 - t)*actions       the interpolant
    u_t   = noise - actions                 its velocity, CONSTANT in t
    v_t   = action_out(expert(embed(x_t, t)))
    L     = mean over the REAL action dims of (v_t - u_t)^2

⚠ **`u_t = noise − actions`, not `actions − noise`.** Both are shape-identical
and the second trains a model that drives the chunk the wrong way. The
endpoints are what pin it: at `t = 1`, `x_t` is the noise; at `t = 0`, `x_t` is
the actions. `test_flow_loss.mojo` asserts both exactly.

⚠ **The loss covers only the first `ADIM_REAL` action dimensions.** The chunk
is padded to `max_action_dim = 32` and the SO-101 has 6, so 26 of every 32
columns of `actions` are zeros. `lerobot` slices `losses[:, :, :original_action_dim]`
before reducing. Skipping that slice does NOT crash and does not look wrong:
it trains the network to predict `u_t = noise − 0 = noise` on 26 columns —
pure noise, unpredictable by construction — and every one of those columns
contributes gradient. The padded columns must receive EXACTLY zero.

⚠ **`x_t` still spans all 32 columns**, because `action_in_proj` takes 32. Only
the LOSS is truncated. Truncating `x_t` too would change the network's input.

⚠ **And the loss is masked per TIMESTEP as well as per column.** A chunk that
runs off the end of its episode is not short — `dataset_reader` CLAMPS the
query index, so those slots hold the last real action repeated, and marks them
in `action_is_pad`. Training on them teaches the model that every episode ends
by holding still. The reference zeroes those timesteps AND removes them from
the denominator (`losses.sum() / num_valid`); doing only the first would leave
the loss scaled by the fraction of valid steps, which changes the effective
learning rate with how close the sample sits to an episode boundary.

`valid` is `[B, CHUNK]`, 1.0 or 0.0, and `n_valid` is the count of 1s. The
caller builds both because the caller is what knows where the episode ended.

⚠ Where the reference does `num_valid.clamp_min(1)`, this RAISES. A batch with
no valid timestep at all is a broken sampler, and a loss quietly divided by 1
is a number that looks like a loss.

## The time distribution

`Beta(alpha, 1)` has density `alpha * x^(alpha-1)` and therefore CDF `x^alpha`,
so its inverse is `u^(1/alpha)` and one uniform sample is enough — no
rejection, no Dirichlet, and no dependence on a Beta sampler the stdlib does
not have. That identity holds ONLY for `beta == 1`, which is why this file
asserts it at compile time rather than carrying a `beta` that would be
silently ignored.

⚠ Sampling `t` UNIFORMLY instead would run, train, and converge to something
else: `Beta(1.5, 1)` has mean 0.6 and puts most of its mass near `t = 1`, the
noisy end, which is where the velocity is hardest to predict. The gate
measures the CDF against `x^1.5` and separately demonstrates that a uniform
draw fails it.
