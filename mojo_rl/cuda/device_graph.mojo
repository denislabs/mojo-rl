"""Record-and-replay a device step on MAX's own `DeviceGraph`.

The replacement for `mojo_rl/cuda/graph.mojo`. Same job, none of the shim:
MAX 26.5 ships `DeviceGraph` / `DeviceGraphBuilder` in `max.gpu.host`, so we
no longer discover MAX's internal stream by `dlsym` interposition and call
`cuStreamBeginCapture` on a stream we do not own.

Measured on an RTX 5090 by `benchmarks/bench_device_graph_spike.mojo`: a
`recording_context()` records our LayoutTensor kernels AND MAX library calls
unmodified, `build` executes nothing, and replay reproduces the work exactly.
Read that file's header before changing anything here.

## What this deletes

`graph.mojo`'s own comments are the bill for borrowing a stream:
`cuStreamDestroy` on our handle, driver SIGSEGVs in `BeginCapture` /
`EndCapture` / `GetCaptureInfo`, a load-bearing `_ctx` field, capture that
"succeeds" with ZERO nodes and says nothing, and
[[_the_preload_is_a_property_of_the_process_not_the_binary]] — a binary you
BUILD and run directly silently loses capture entirely, because `LD_PRELOAD`
comes from pixi's nvidia activation and not from the binary. None of that
exists here. There is no interceptor, no preload, and no `.so` to build.

## The one thing callers must change

`STEP` takes a `DeviceContext` **argument** instead of capturing one. That is
not cosmetic and it cannot be avoided: recording happens because operations are
enqueued through the *recording* context, so a step that reaches for its own
`self.ctx` records nothing and runs eagerly instead — silently, since the work
is still correct. Thread the argument all the way down to the enqueue calls.

## A view built into a local and captured by `STEP` is DEAD

Mojo destroys a value at its LAST USE, and **a mention inside a closure that is
only ever passed as a COMPTIME PARAMETER does not count as one.** So this is
wrong, and wrong silently:

    var lt = LayoutTensor[DT, Layout.row_major(1)](buf)   # <- dies HERE
    def _step(gctx: DeviceContext) capturing raises -> None:
        gctx.enqueue_function[_bump](lt, grid_dim=1, block_dim=1)

Every launch then writes through a dead view. Nothing raises, the graph still
records, and the counter comes back 0. The first draft of
`tests/cuda/test_device_graph_minimal.mojo` did exactly this.

⚠ **THE COMPILER TELLS YOU: `assignment to 'lt' was never used`.** In a file
whose very next line hands `lt` to a kernel, that reads like a false positive.
It is not — it is the whole bug.

Build views INSIDE the step, or capture something whose lifetime is anchored
elsewhere. The production shape is the same rule one level up: **one struct owns
the context and the buffers, and `STEP` mentions only that struct and calls a
method on it.** Every crash in this area came from skipping it.

## Fallback is a RUNTIME latch, not a comptime no-op — and that difference bites

`CUDAGraph` was `comptime if has_nvidia_gpu_accelerator()`, so off NVIDIA it
compiled away and `maybe_capture_replay` ran `STEP` every call. `DeviceGraph`
does not compile away: it links everywhere and RAISES at runtime.

    "Graph capture is currently implemented for CUDA and HIP devices only.
     Creating a graph on any other device, such as an Apple GPU or a CPU,
     raises."                              — MAX API docs for `device_graph`

(On an M1 that surfaces as `createGraphBuilder() not supported on this device
context`, and a CPU `DeviceContext` raises too — so this is not an Apple-only
concern, CI without a GPU hits it as well.)

So the first `create` is wrapped and its outcome LATCHED: on a raise the slot
goes permanently `disabled` and every later call runs `STEP` directly. A
comptime gate would need to enumerate the supported backends and would be wrong
the moment Modular adds one; attempting once and remembering cannot be.

⚠ **DO NOT RECORD A STEP THAT CONTAINS A MAX-ALLOCATED GEMM WORKSPACE.**
Measured, same spike, same card: `multistage_gemm`'s split-K workspace and
`matmul_vendor`'s 32MB scratch are allocated through
`ctx.enqueue_create_buffer`, which `recording_context` FORWARDS to the backing
context, and freed when the call returns while the recorded node keeps the raw
pointer. The 512KB split-K case replays with the RIGHT ANSWER while silently
writing over whatever the allocator handed the block to next; the 32MB vendor
case is a hard `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` on the FIRST replay, and the error
is sticky. Neither raises at record time. Before recording a step, check it
with `-D LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO`:

    | grep -c 'K partitions: [2-9]'          # MAX-dispatched split-K
    | grep -c 'Executing: vendor BLAS'       # 32MB scratch per call

Both must be 0. Our own `nn/core/splitk_gemm.mojo` takes a caller-owned
workspace and is safe by construction; it is MAX's dispatch that is not.

## !! AND THAT RULES OUT MOST RL STEPS TODAY — MEASURED, NOT FEARED

`multi_gemm_cond` (matmul/gpu/__init__.mojo:591) is

    m > 1 and n % 128 == 0 and k % 32 == 0 and k >= 128

so a `Linear` whose INPUT width is under 128, or whose OUTPUT width is not a
multiple of 128, goes to `matmul_vendor` and its 32MB-per-call scratch. **That
is the first and last layer of every actor and critic we have.** SAC on
Pendulum (`OBS=3, ACT=1, H=128`) hits it four ways:

    actor  L1   [256,3] @ [3,128]     k=3    -> vendor
    critic L1   [256,4] @ [4,128]     k=4    -> vendor
    actor  head 128 -> 2              n=2    -> vendor
    critic head 128 -> 1              n=1    -> vendor

Recording that step dies with `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` a few hundred
updates in. Under STREAM capture the same allocation RAISES, MAX catches it at
matmul/gpu/__init__.mojo:1373 and drops to `matmul_kernel_naive` — correct,
slower, alive. **So for any step containing a vendor-path GEMM, stream capture
is strictly SAFER than recording, and small obs/act dims make that nearly every
deep-RL step.**

⚠ **THEREFORE `mojo_rl/cuda/graph.mojo` CANNOT BE RETIRED YET.** The mechanism
here works — `benchmarks/bench_device_graph_spike.mojo` arms A/B/C pass and
`tests/cuda/test_device_graph_minimal.mojo` records on a 5090 — but real
training steps hit MAX's allocator. This module stays behind
`MOJO_RL_GRAPH_BACKEND=device` as dormant infrastructure until either MAX
allocates through `DeviceGraphBuilder.create_buffer` (the API its own docstring
tells callers to use), or every GEMM in the step is routed off the vendor path.

⚠ **CHECK THE CANDIDATE, DO NOT REASON FROM "its shapes look fine".** SAC was
picked as the first migration precisely because its MLP GEMMs "never hit
split-K or the vendor path". The split-K half was right; the vendor half was
never checked, and the two greps above would have taken one run.

    """Record `STEP` into `slot` on first call; replay it thereafter.

    `STEP` must enqueue the SAME kernel sequence every call — the recorded
    graph holds raw pointers, so a step whose shapes or buffers vary between
    calls cannot be replayed. Device-side RNG is fine (and intended): each
    replay advances the counter, so a captured sampling step still draws a
    fresh minibatch.

    ⚠ EVERY BUFFER `STEP` TOUCHES MUST OUTLIVE THE LAST REPLAY, not the
    recording. A graph holds raw device pointers; Mojo destroys a value at its
    LAST USE. One struct that owns the context and the buffers, with `STEP`
    mentioning only that struct, is the shape that makes this true by
    construction — and the shape every crash in this area came from skipping.

    ⚠ HOST BOOKKEEPING DOES NOT BELONG IN `STEP`. Step counters and metric
    cadence live in the caller's loop, advanced once per logical update, so
    they stay correct whether the step ran directly or via replay. Host work
    inside `STEP` is recorded ONCE and then never happens again.

    On the first call `STEP` runs once — to settle the stream and let module
    loads, autotuning and any first-call allocation happen OUTSIDE the
    recording — and the graph is then built from a second, non-executing pass.
