"""`bmm_tiled` — a batched matmul for the shapes MAX's dispatch leaves on the
floor, namely attention's two products.

`bmm` (MAX's `batched_matmul`) is the right default nearly everywhere. It is
not the right default for `Q.Kt` and `A.V`: MAX's multistage GEMM wants
`n % 128 == 0` and `k >= 128`, and BOTH attention products fail that — scores
have `k = HEAD_DIM` (64), the context product has `n = HEAD_DIM` — so both
fall to the vendor path. Measured (`benchmarks/attention_matmul_bench.mojo`),
SigLIP's 1.61 GFLOP product took 18.2 ms on an M1 and 0.224 ms on a 5090:
88 and 7200 GFLOP/s, a tenth of each machine.

Two kernels, because the shapes that need this are not one family:

  * `_bmm_tile4_kernel` — a 64x64 output tile per block, 16x16 threads, 4x4
    outputs each. Each shared-memory element is reused four times from
    registers. It wants a big output: 8.4x on an M1 and 4.0x on a 5090 at
    SigLIP's shape, but 0.75-0.85x on ACT's DEPLOY shapes (M=60, N=32), where
    a 64x64 tile is mostly out-of-bounds threads.
  * `_bmm_tile1_kernel` — 16x16, one output per thread. 2.1x on an M1 at those
    small shapes, and never slower than `bmm` on a 5090. It covers the shapes
    the big tile cannot fill.

`bmm_tiled_is_worth_it` picks between them (and defers to `bmm` when neither
fits), at compile time, from the extents alone.

Measured with `benchmarks/attention_matmul_bench.mojo` on all three devices.
Orin, against `bmm`: SigLIP 3.92x and 4.68x, ACT's training shapes 2.63x and
1.96x, ACT's deploy shapes 1.84x and 1.48x — the big tile everywhere. A 5090
agrees except at the two deploy shapes; see `MMT_MIN_WORK`.

⚠ NOT A DROP-IN FOR `bmm` EVERYWHERE. These kernels accumulate `k` in
increasing order with no split-K and no tensor cores, which is why they come
out bit-identical to `bmm` at every shape measured — the property the
attention cache gates rely on. A shape with a long `k` and a small output
would be better served by MAX's split-K, which this does not do.
