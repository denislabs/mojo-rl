"""`read_file_bytes` / `write_file_atomic` — the two rules every large blob
this repo writes has to obey, in one place.

## The two rules

**Chunking.** A single `write(2)` silently stops at `0x7FFFF000` (~2 GiB) on
Linux and returns the short count. Ignoring that return is how checkpoint v2
produced TRUNCATED files that loaded without complaint at DreamerV3 size200m.
`read(2)` has the same cap. So neither direction may issue one call for the
whole payload; both loop in `_CHUNK`-sized pieces.

**Atomicity.** The payload lands in `path + ".tmp"` and is `rename(2)`d over
`path` only once fully written. `rename` is atomic within a filesystem, so a
crash mid-save cannot destroy the previous good file — which for a checkpoint
is the difference between losing one save and losing the run.

## Why it is here and not in `nn/core/checkpoint.mojo`

It was there first, and correctly. It moved when `io/safetensors.mojo` needed
the same two rules: a second transcription of a rule is a second thing to keep
in step, and this repo's most frequent defect shape by a distance is a rule
written inline twice. `checkpoint.mojo` keeps its `_write_file_bytes` /
`_read_file_bytes` names as one-line forwards, so nothing that imported them
changed.
