"""The goal language — `goal=In(brick, box_inside)` — P2.

A `.task`'s `goal=` is TEXT in `spec.mojo` and a small NUMERIC PROGRAM here.
Two steps, and the split is the design:

    parse_goal("In(brick, box_inside)")   -> a tree of terms holding NAMES
    bind_goal(goal, family, model)        -> the same tree holding INDICES

## ⚠⚠ THE NUMERIC PROGRAM IS THE POINT, AND IT IS FOR THE GPU

`TASK_LAYER_PLAN.md` §5.1: LIBERO calls `_check_success()` from Python every
step; at 1024 lanes a per-step host round-trip would dominate the step, so
**the goal predicate is part of the reward and runs where the reward runs.** A
`BoundGoal` is a fixed-capacity array of `(op, a, b, param)` — exactly the
shape that becomes P3's device tape, read by a switch in the reward kernel.
Nothing here allocates, nothing here holds a string.

That is also why binding is a separate pass: the strings are resolved ONCE, on
the host, at task-load time. A kernel never sees a name.

## ⚠ TIER A vs TIER B — AND WHAT L3 MOVED

* **Tier A** reads per-lane `Data` the reward kernel is already handed:
  `xpos` / `xquat` / `site_xpos` / `qpos`, the model's `sites` and `bodies`
  tables, and — since L3 — the lane's own CONTACT LIST (`contacts` +
  `meta[META_IDX_NUM_CONTACTS]`, exactly what `sensors/touch.mojo` reads).
  In, On, Near, Above, Upright, AtRegion, Joint, Touching, and `On(obj, obj)`.
* **Tier B** is what has NO defined semantics yet: Grasped. It parses and
  binds and is refused by `require_tier_a` and by the tape.

⚠ THE OLD SPLIT WAS "Tier B needs the contact array, which is CPU-only".
That premise was wrong by the time L3 looked: `Phyics3dBatchedEnv` passes
`contacts` to `compute_reward_and_done_gpu` and the touch sensor evaluates
per lane from it. The LIBERO port needed `On(a, b)` = `b.check_ontop(a)` =
z order + CONTACT + xy < 0.03, so the contact test moved to Tier A rather
than the benchmark's most common predicate being approximated.

## THE L3 OPS, AND THE LIBERO SEMANTICS THEY CARRY

* `Joint(joint, cmp, thr)` — `qpos[joint] <cmp> thr`, cmp in lt/le/gt/ge.
  LIBERO's `Open/Close/Turnon/Turnoff` are this with a per-CLASS comparison
  (`categories.kv`); `Open` on a multi-joint object is ANY joint (`Or`),
  `Close` is ALL (`And`), quoted from `ObjectState.is_open/is_close`.
* `On(obj, obj)` — bound to `OP_ON_BODY`: `check_ontop` verbatim, with the
  ARGUMENT INVERSION LIBERO's `On.__call__` performs (`arg2.check_ontop(arg1)`)
  resolved here, once — see `eval.pred_ontop`.
* `On(obj, box region)` / `In(obj, box region)` — a region declared
  `:box:` (`spec.RegionSpec.is_box`) evaluates as LIBERO's `SiteObject.under`
  / `in_box`, in the site's frame, with an optional CONTACT partner slot.

## ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO

It does not evaluate. Evaluation reads `Data` and belongs with the env wiring;
keeping the LANGUAGE separate is what lets the parser be gated without a
physics step, and what stops a second half-parser appearing in a kernel.
